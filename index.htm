</b></u></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who
are reading this and don't know
me...well, why are you reading this? Secondly, my name is Jason
and I live in Nashville. Madison if you want to be all specific
about it. But it's Nashville enough. This is the story of my
magical musical adventure that lead to nowhere. This was a terrible
intro but I don't really know what else to say. Oh oh oh, I know, WHY I
wrote this instead of simply doing a normal music website. I think we
had some really dumb and funny stories to share so I did. Plus, I want
to file away these stories for myself. Every day I get older more
memories disappear, now I can read this and go LOL, I forgot about that
idiotic thing I did that one time! <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>But mainly because I thought it would be fun. I've
read a lot of books and I've watched
a lot of documentaries about musicians and bands over the years. Almost
every single time I do I am shocked by how similar the stories of those
bands are to my own band's story. It seems no matter how big or how
small, every band seems to go through much of same crap. Only the scale
and amount of substances change. Whether they're a world famous all
time great band or whether
they are band of absolute nobodies who never accomplished anything. And
I always used to think, wouldn't it be kinda funny if somebody who
never actually did anything wrote their own autobiography as if they
were just as important as that famous band? I never wrote the book
because why would I? But I did write whatever this is. So enjoy the
uncensored, hard hitting, no holds barred tales of an useless,
talentless douche who never accomplished anything but wrote about it
anyway.<br>

<p align="left"><u><b>Chapter One</b></u>
</p>

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a kid I had no interest in playing
music at
all.&nbsp; None.&nbsp; Zip.&nbsp; Nada.&nbsp; Zilch.&nbsp; Zero.&nbsp;
I really didn't even listen to that much music. The only musical
group that I was into enough to buy all their albums was The Fat Boys.
I was a weird little
douche who would much rather listen to the Fat Boys than Led
Zeppelin. My only musical "talent" was beatboxing for my Grandma
and having her pretend I was the most talented little boy in the whole
wide world.
Not much has changed over the decades really except that now I don't
believe her anymore. Besides that most of my musical influences came
from all the Duran Duran and Billy Idol that my mom listened to while
she did her Jane Fonda workouts and the Hank Williams Jr that my dad
listened to when he did...eh...whatever the hell it was he did. <br>
<br>
The first real music that grabbed me was actually blues. One day I was
digging
through my grandparent's record collection and trying to find something
that wasn't some old boring country music crap and I came across this
double
album called Swamp Blues. It was awesome. I started listening to it
every time I went over there until they finally gave it to me and let
me take it home. I also inherited a couple of my dad's records. Black
Sabbath's Paranoid and The Beatles' White Album. Now I had two of the
best albums of all time, plus a Beatles album. At
this point my entire musical life was Fat Boys, Swamp Blues, Fat Boys,
Black Sabbath, Fat Boys and knowing from a very early age that The
Beatles were overrated nonsense.<br>
<br>
In 1987 or so I heard Guns N Roses for the first
time and all of sudden my pecker started twitching. Now this is
something. I definitely started beatboxing less. But I still had no
interest in actually PLAYING music. I was still way more
interested in playing with my GI Joes than trying
to play a musical instrument. I couldn't care less about that. Never
entered my mind. But out of the friggin blue, a teacher's stupid
mistake pretty much changed the rest of my life. This stupid
teacher, who I already hated, made everything you read and hear on this
website
happen. I hope she got fired and you will too after you hear some of
this awful crap.<br>
</b>
<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It happened during the last
year of the 6th
grade. The last <i>week</i> to be specific. The next year
we would be heading off to that great paradise in the sky known as
Junior High. Leaving one school to go to the other meant we had
lots of paper work to fill out. Leaving middle school for junior
high meant that this was the first time in our school lives that we
actually had some say in the type of classes we wanted to take,
electives, sports and what not.&nbsp; </b></p>

<p align="left"><b>We had a field trip on one of our last days of
school to go bowling. This was a very educational trip. But as my
entire home room
class sat on the bus waiting to leave, this dumb teacher passed out a
slip of paper to fill out to all of us who were going to Neely's Bend
Junior High and not some other savage school in the ghetto. She
claimed that we HAD to fill this paper out before we could change
schools
but even us dumb kiddies could read this slip of paper and see that it
was a form to join band class. Many of us told the teacher that
this slip was for band and that if we filled it out we'd wind up in
band class and the vast majority of us did NOT want to be in band. She
wouldn't listen of course. She was a teacher, we
were kids, she knew better. So we were all forced to sign up
for band class whether&nbsp;we wanted to or not. She held up the
bus from leaving until
we did it. The other kids were burning holes into us with their eyes
because we were ruining bowling day. I reluctantly filled it out so we
could take this
exciting learning trip to the bowling alley and handed it in. I
then spent the entire summer absolutely dreading being a part of the
band and hoping it somehow wouldn't happen. What the hell would I
play? Who would I even know in a room full of band nerds? I mean,
besides all these other assholes who were forced to fill it out too.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next year begins and
there I am in band class
against all of my wishes, along with several other kids from my old
school
that got tricked into it.&nbsp; Some of them lucky bastards managed to
get out of it but not us saps. Now the truly tough part begins....what
the hell instrument am I gonna play? If I had been a girl it
would've been easy.&nbsp; Girls are only allowed to play a few
instruments. A band like this? They play the flute. In a rock band?
They play bass.&nbsp; Since a junior high band
doesn't need a bass player, they just go oh, I'll play flute, it's an
easy
decision! But I was a dorky little boy in my husky
jeans. I had to choose from EVERYTHING. I somehow found
myself at Madison Music with my Mom renting me a trumpet. A
TRUMPET. What a&nbsp; horrible decision. The trumpet??? Yuck! What an
awful instrument the trumpet was. Satchmo I was not. I turned out not
to be very good at sticking a
long hard shaft in my mouth and blowing on it. I was <i>miserable</i>
at it actually. At first it was a total blast because I was just
sitting on the porch tooting away like a dumb ass, annoying the&nbsp;
living piss out of the neighborhood. But when it came time
to play actual notes
in some sort of order that resembled music? I couldn't play the
trumpet at all and after a couple of weeks I gave up on it. To this
day, it is the only instrument that I have tried to learn that I
couldn't at least fake my way through. The only person in the class
worse than me was Michael Fish. He was trying the baritone horn I
believe and all
I remember him doing was blurting out a few wrong notes then staring at
the sheet
music and shaking his red cheeked face at it. I've seen that dude shake
his
head while
staring at sheet music more times than I've seen my toes. It haunts me
to this day.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So here I am, <i>still</i>
stuck in band class and
once again, instrument-less. But my decision would be much easier this
time. After a few weeks of taking part in this snooze-fest class,
I had noticed something. All the people playing the
woodwinds and brass instruments were actually trying and taking it
seriously and were boring the life out of me. But there was a
group of dudes waaaaaaaaaaaaaay off in the back of the room that didn't
do a damn thing. They just acted like idiots all day, they all
had mullets, they all wore Motley Crue and GnR shirts and got to beat
things with sticks all day. The choice was easy this time. "Mr.
Flynt, I
want to play drums." An annoyed Mr. Flynt waved his arms and said
"Well, get back there then". </b><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
</p>

<p align="left"><b>This decision didn't just lead me to becoming a
drummer, it led to me becoming friends with Mike, who would be my
BFF...well... minus the forever part, for the rest of my miserable
school days. We actually knew each
other before which also helped me pick drums since I figured I would
have an ally. My family had previously lived next door to his lesbian
aunt and he would stay at her place sometimes and we would hang out and
ride our bikes. We weren't really friends yet, we were just two fellas
thrown together and hung out because nobody else was there. Once
we moved I wasn't like "oh nooooooo, Miiiiiiiike, how will I live" or
anything. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During tat summer before
starting junior high I remember his
lesbian aunt came over to our new house to visit and brought Mike with
her. I seem to remember at this time he either brought a guitar with
him or he mentioned he was playing guitar now but I still couldn't care
less at that point so I didn't pay any attention. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>At some point we ended up sitting on the front
porch playing with my GI Joes while the adults did their drug deals or
whatever adults were into. Well...when I say we were playing with GI
Joes
what I mean to say is...*I* was playing with the GI Joes. Mike was
bored. At some point
I noticed Mike just picking one of the GI Joes up and just kinda
staring at it in his
hand. The way he looked at it I started getting a weird feeling. My
life suddenly came crashing down all around me. The camera did that
zoom in and zoom out thing at the same time. I was having a
mid-childhood crisis. Am I supposed to be too old to play with toys
now? I fully realized that this dude thought I was a complete dork. I
didn't know what was happening. Mike left and I never talked to him
again until the day I switched to drums. But after he left that day I
was shaken to my core. I feel like that's when everything started to
change. Mike had moved on from toys and was playing guitar. Was it time
for me to find something new too?<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike was a big tall lanky
glass of water and I was a
short little chubby kid with a bowl hair cut. I was one drool away from
looking like I belonged in special ed. Mike and I became the Laurel and
Hardy of the drum line, which also included Larry and Greg. Looking
back, the 4 of us were complete idiots. If I had
been the band teacher, I'd have lost my mind dealing with the 4 of us.
And, well, Mr. Flynt DID lose his mind. Several times. That dude had a
real anger management problem that we did nothing to help. None
of us took it seriously, we hated the class, we didn't listen to a word
he said, we just sat in the back of the room talking through the entire
class and then banged the crap out of the drums while the band
played. Sometimes we played intentionally wild and out of time
just to be assholes.&nbsp; Mr. Flynt didn't call us the drummers. He
called us the dumbers. We got screamed at and sent to the hall more
times than I can possibly remember. I fully admit we were assholes and
I
have zero idea how Mr. Flynt put up with us as well as he did. I don't
know how he put
up with any of it. Spending your entire professional life listening to
kids try to
play instruments they can't play has to be absolutely hellish. But he
was still a real bastard to deal with. An absolute creep. He looked
like a police sketch of every child molestor ever. But I digress...more
importantly, from
these other guys, I seriously got deeper into music. The Fat
Boys were out of my life forever. I was a die hard rock and roll
guy now. Suddenly my room started filling up with cassettes and
records and band posters. I got Dr Feelgood on cassette for
Christmas. Columbia House made a lot of my parent's money over the next
few years and I started working on my mullet.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Larry was the wildest of our drum group and he
eventually got kicked out of class for good after he put the leg of a
chair on top of a snare drum and then sat on it to see what it would
do. It seemed like a good idea at the time so we encouraged it
and then laughed our asses off. I have never heard anything as loud as
the sound of that drum head popping as the chair crashed through
it. Well...except for the hellish scream Mr Flynt unleashed at
Larry to get out of his class. That was pretty loud and crazy too. A
echo-y concrete room and a screaming teacher make a ridiculous
combination. Shortly after Larry was gone, Greg was gone
too. He was one of them troubled kids who ran away from
home. Not only did we lose our 4th drummer but also our one black
friend. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>That left just Laurel and Hardy back there. But
through all of this utter nonsense I discovered something....drums
felt...easy? This wasn't at all like the trumpet. Even though we
spent more time goofing off than playing, it still came pretty
easy to me. I could tell something was happening here by watching Mike
completely struggle at it. We practiced the exact same amount, we
were in the same class with the same teacher, yet I would ace it and he
would bungle everything. Sometimes we HAD to actually take it
seriously. We would have to pass tests in order to get a passing
grade. The tests meant everyone had to go into the Mr. Flynt's
office one by one with a piece of sheet music and play solo for him. I
would always go in and nail it. Everytime Mr. Flynt would be shocked
at how one of the trouble making jerk offs from the back of the room
got one of the best grades out of the class. I remember being so proud
during one of these tests because I played it so well that he got mad
at me. That dude wanted to flunk me so bad but couldn't. All this led
to me realizing I had finally found a replacement for GI Joes.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through those two years of
junior high Mike was also
continuing to learn guitar. He was doing much better at that than
drums. He had another friend named Richard who had a drum set and the
two of them
would get together and jam. I was a bit envious of this as that
sounded like real fun. I was stuck at home in fantasy land, surrounding
myself with pillows and beating on them like they were my
drumset. Luckily for me his drummer friend wasn't
very good and wasn't very reliable to actually be able to do anything
real with. I saw my opening.&nbsp; <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>After a lot of begging and
pleading, during the summer between Junior High and High School I got
my first drum set. I remember getting those drums being another
life changing moment where I learned about the concept of negotiation.
We found this drumset for sale in the classified ads and my parents and
I drove off to check it out. We knew what the price was and I knew full
well we brought the money the guy was asking for. After looking
the drums over my dad started talking to the guy about the price. I
don't
remember what they cost but I'll say 300. My dad goes "well, we only
brought 200". I was once against shaken to my core. I was suddenly
furious. Here was my drumset finally. Here was my future. Here was my
replacement for GI Joes. This was my band with Mike. My destiny was
right in front of me and all of sudden he says he didn't bring the
$300?? Fudge
that. I looked at my
father with shock and fury burning in my eyes and asked him why he was
lying. He
looked at me like WTF, the dude looked at him like LOL and I went home
with my
drums. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>It was an old, dirty, ugly 5 piece set of off-white
Pearl drums but
they did the job. I picked up some sticks and went to town and just as
I had hoped, 5 drums were just as easy to play as the 1 drum in band
class. Not saying I was Neil Peart or anything, but, you know,
easy enough to do the non-sense that we would do. I started calling
Mike in an effort to brag about my drum set but he would never return
my phone call. For weeks. I should've seen this as a sign that this
wasn't a relationship destined for greatness but I was one eager little
beaver.
My mom eventually drove me to his house and I posted a note on his
front door.&nbsp; </b></p>

<p align="left"><b>"Mike - Call me, ask about MY DRUM SET - Jason"</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Uggh. I can't believe he didn't throw this note in
the
trash can. My face is already getting hot. I can't believe how
embarrassed I am already and we haven't even got to hearing the music
yet. Believe me, in a while, you'll see that this note isn't the worst
thing I ever wrote. But the note worked and it worked fast. The next
thing I knew Mike was coming over several times a week with
his guitar and we were rocking out. We were no longer stuck
playing those boring band class songs. We were RAWKING! We
were playing GnR songs, Motley Crue songs, Queensryche songs, Black
Sabbath songs, you name it. Were we good at it? NOOOOOO!! God, we
sucked. Listening to it now I am flabbergasted
at how bad at drums I was for a guy who felt like it was so easy. Mike
could kinda play but kinda couldn't. I don't know how my parents
tolerated
it. But we didn't care or know better at the time, we were rocking like
a
hurricane. We even had a strobe light we were rocking so hard. You can
even hear how rocking we are because I found a cassette of us rawking
and here it is. I wouldn't recommend it though.<br>

</p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We moved on to high school
and 9th grade was to be
our last year
in the school band and it was more of the same as junior high. We
goofed off in the back while everybody else tried to learn. Except this
time the teacher was much nicer. Yet, I can't remember his name because
he didn't make nearly the impression Mr. Flynt did. Even Larry was back
with us for a while, but got kicked out again and eventually dropped
out of school completely. That entire 9th grade year was filled
with just waiting for school to end so we could go home to play real
music. Eventually we started getting better with all this
practice. We still sucked, but sucked a little less than we
did. Besides being in regular band Mike was also in the string
band. String band was a special thing at our school that taught mostly
bluegrass music. They taught guitar, mandolin, banjo, bass, etc. Being
in a real guitar class Mike started getting better. Nobody was teaching
me anything about playing a drumset. I got better much slower. I didn't
join string band until
12th grade and in that one year all I learned was how to sorta play
mandolin and one scale on the guitar. I wish I would've also joined the
string bang in 9th and got a better start on guitar but I had no idea
the class existed then or that I ever would've been interested.</b></p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our life in the high
school band ended because had we stayed in it for 10th grade we
would've been forced to move on to the marching band and that was a
terrible idea. Those costumes? That...marching? Hell no. What we were
in was called concert band. All we did was go on field tripes to
places, we stood there
and played concerts. That was bad enough. Who wanted to have to learn
dance
moves on top of learning the music? How awful marching band would be
was crystalized
at a high school football game where Mike and I were asked to be
basically the marching band's roadies. We were next in line to be the
marching band's drum line of the future, which had to be a sad idea for
everyone involved, so they wanted us to start taking
part and getting to see what marching band was like. That was a bad
idea because
we suddenly realized marching band wouldn't allow us to be goofs in the
back of the room, this seemed hard and serious. One thing we had to do
as the roadies was carry this big xylophone thing
down to the field before the band got there. The xylophone had wheels,
pushing it down the walkway from the school area down to the football
area
was easy. But once we got there we had to navigate it down the steps
through the bleachers and down to the actual field. As we were bumping
this thing down the steps the FUDGING WHEELS FELL OFF.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">As we're trying to
find the wheels for this thing and stick them back on we start hearing
the music. We start hearing the stomp of feet. It gets louder and
louder
and louder. Eventually we look up and there is the marching band at the
top of the steps and heading down our way. Panic. Absolute panic. I
look up there and see WTF in the eyes of the guy leading the band down.
I would like to say time stood still but it didn't. It sped up
astronomically. There is a whole line of people playing instruments
heading our way and they can't stop. Only the one in front even knows
there's a problem. If he stops suddenly, do the ones in back stop too?
Or
does it cause a massive spill of oboe players down the stairs until
they all crash into the broken down xylophone and the two dumbasses
trying to move it? We might be fixing to kill the marching band. So now
we have to try to pick this thing up and move it without the wheels.
And the thing is, the reason this thing has wheels is
because it's friggin heavy as pissballs and moving it on wheels is much
easier. But we have no choice. The sound of RAT DAT DA DAT DAT is
surging down the stairs and right at us. As more of them get on the
stairs, more of them can see us and they're looking at us like we're
the biggest assholes ever. We struggle down the last few steps with
this thing and carry it a couple of feet to the side of the stairs with
no time at all to spare. It was like a movie scene where the guy clips
the wire on the bomb just as the timer ticks to :01. After that night
we wanted nothing to do with the marching band ever again. It seemed
far too stressful.<br>
</span></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we were getting
marginally better in our
little two man band, which I had now named Thrash Cans, it was also
getting tiresome being two idiots
in a bedroom
playing arena rock songs and we definitely wanted to find more idiots
for our
band. We needed a bass player. We needed a singer. No talent
needed, just warm bodies. But 9th grade came and went and we found
neither one. Years later I wonder how that is. I mean, Mike was
literally in what amounted to a guitar
class with a bunch of other guys playing guitar and bass and he
couldn't find anyone? The entire string band section of the school was
nothing but metal heads, punks, stoners, drop outs and assorted creeps
like us. It seems like trying to find somebody that wanted to jam
some rock tunes after school should've been pretty easy. A lot easier
than me looking in science class. It occurs to
me that perhaps I was the only one
actually looking very hard. When I said "we" wanted to find more
members of the band what I I think it most mostly meant was *I* did.
While I was almost
immediately all the way in on being a band and going full speed ahead,
Mike's commitment to pushing the band forward mostly bounced between
"whatever" at worst and "I guess" at best. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At some point around here,
for some reason, I
decided to start learning the bass myself. I don't know why. I couldn't
play them both at the same time. </b><b>So back to the classified ads
we went. I
found a cheap bass for sale and my mom and I met some guy at a library
and for 50 bucks or so I had a bass. It was a terrible red Series 10
bass
that weighed at least 600 pounds easily. This was around the
time that GnR's video for You Could Be Mine was out. In it Slash played
a BC Rich Mockingbird guitar that was red with black stripes. So I got
some black tape and added black stripes to my red Series 10 bass. It
looked just like it!! Not. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">After getting my bass
I needed to learn how to play it. Did I take lessons? Of course not. I
went to Sam Goody and bought a book and cassette package called "How To
Play Hard Rock Bass". The cassette had like 5 one minute long generic
tracks and the book had the tab so you could play along with them. A
day
later I was a bass player. EASY. Also around this time I had this weird
boombox thing that had two tape decks in it. You could play a cassette
in the first deck to record to the second deck but while doing that you
could also record through the microphone at the same time. This made it
essentially a
really bad, cheapo multitrack recorder. I decided it was time for
Thrash Cans to finally release their debut album. And for some reason
it would be live.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">I basically just took
some random songs from our various jam sessions and put them together
with a bunch of other weird nonsense. We used the
boombox microphone for Mike to add some solos to the songs and I added
bass to them. But the thing is, since Mike was the only guitar player
in our jam sessions he didn't actually have to make sure he was in tune
with anybody else for most of the time. Also, I'm sure I hadn't
mastered the art of tuning the bass yet. I doubt that 10 page "How to
Play Rock Bass" pamphlet even mentioned tuning. So now we're going back
to add these other parts to a
guitar that isn't in tune and it sounds hilariously terrible. I also
had a cheapo Casio keyboard which taught you to how to play a few
songs. One of them was House of the Rising Sun and so I sorta learned
that and then recorded myself playing it for an ungodly amount of time.
I also recorded myself playing along with the generic songs from the
how to play bass cassette. And inbetween all of this weird awful music
is fake giant crowd
noises. I listened to this again for the first time in years recently
and I really expected to cringe myself to the point of suicide. But I
actually found it oddly enjoyable. It's weird and awful but it's weird
and
awful in a funny way. It's like something that would be on one of those
really weird Adult Swim shows. The problem is that those are ironic.
They
are made to be weird and awful on purpose. This was made deadly serious

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally at the
start of 10th grade, I wound up sitting next to Keaton in science
class. Keaton was also in string band with Mike but apparently Mike
couldn't find him as they played guitar in the same class every day.
*Ahem* Once again, I had actually sorta known Keaton
before, way back
in middle school, but back then I had no interest in being his friend,
he seemed like a total jerk and I never talked to him. He even
got beat up by a girl back then. I mean, damn. Not that he would've
wanted to know me back then either. I was such an idiot in middle
school that I ran for the school council as the treasury secretary or
whatever the fudge. I put up posters in the hallway that was a picture
of Voltron saying "Vote for Jason" and when I gave my speech to the
school I was like "I'm gonna help make sure we take more field trips
and we're gonna eat pizza for lunch everyday yaaahhhh" All this crap
the student council doesn't have anything to do with. My face is hot
again. What a douche. Damn. Who even was I back then? <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Anyway, now that I was getting to
know Keaton it turned out that I was right and he really was an epic
jerk.
We became friends anyway.&nbsp; I found out he played guitar and sang
and "OMG, yes, yes, yes, I did it, I found him, it's our third, we're
gonna be famous".&nbsp; We started talking music and we didn't really
have much in common. He was a big fan of Iron Maiden and
Danzig, two bands I couldn't
give a crap about, and he didn't really like Motley Crue or
Guns N Roses. Despite his awful taste in music I still started trying
to talk him into
playing with us.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>My hopes were dashed as he revealed to me that he
was already in a band. One day he asked me if I wanted to hear
them and I said yeah. The next day he brought me a tape of his
band so I went home right after school and popped it in. I
was floored at what I heard. This band sounded
awesome. I listened to it multiple times that night. I laid in my bed
that night listening to it on my walkman. I didn't like the music
itself a whole lot but he was
obviously mega talented. And it didn't bother me for one second that
the band
was so good, it made me want him in the band even more. I wondered if I
could steal him away. I just figured he could play in both bands. He
could play with this super awesome amazingly talented band on weekends
and during the week he could play with Thrash Cans and help us learn
how to tune. I went back to
school and told
him how cool his music was like
a total idiot. A couple of days later, Keaton finally fessed up that it
wasn't his band, that he had actually given me a dubbed copy of Iron
Maiden's "Killers" album. This should have been a huge
red flag that this relationship was also doomed to crash in an
Hindenburg
like fashion. But I was an eager little beaver.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b> And, you know, I
think we should really hammer home the point here that I was so
delusional that I
listened to a full Iron Maiden album and honestly, seriously considered
the thought that "well, maybe the guy in this band would also like to
be in our band". I mean, did Iron Maiden own a strobe light? I
seriously doubt it. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><u><b>Chapter Two</b></u></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keaton finally joined the
band to play bass and
sing. Well...sort of. At first he steadfastly refused to play bass. He
played guitar and wanted to play guitar and acted like playing bass was
beneath him. Which is funny because years later he would get mad when I
kept trying to make him stop playing bass. We just let him play guitar
and sing for a while as we continued to try to convince him to start
playing bass so
we'd be a full
band. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Eventually it got the point where the idea that we
would manage to find a fourth person who would fit in with this band of
goobers started to become such an impossibility that even Keaton gave
in and started playing bass. I mean, he didn't put in much effort at it
at first but he
played. He basically just played guitar on the bass. To say he's good
at playing bass is like saying that Gigli is a great movie, almost as
good as Battlefield Earth!&nbsp; He never really mastered the
difference between bass and guitar and never got the fact that the
harder he hit the strings, the more awful he made it sound.
Particularly on
the ol' Series 10. And, of course, we had no bass amp and no fancy PA
system or anything so he both played bass AND sang through one really
old
crappy guitar amp. It sounded terrific!&nbsp; <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We continued with playing
cover songs and just
playing around and jamming for a few months but eventually that started
getting old.&nbsp; Both Keaton and I were feeling ready to move on from
the cover song game. I mean we couldn't really play them well anyway.
If you make your own music nobody can tell you you didn't play it
right. We wanted to start writing our own stuff, but Mike was
very
against the idea. This should've been my second sign that
this relationship was not going to make it to the alter. We
never really understood why
he was so against it. What fun is it to just play other
people's
songs all the time? Yeah, it's fun sometimes but if you play an
instrument, graduating to creating your own music seems like the
logical step. Even if it's an accident. You pick up a guitar and doodle
around and all of a sudden you have a riff. You make up some words. Oh
look, I wrote a song. Looking back after all the years, I think that
to
him, this was all just for fun. It was a hobby. It was just a thing to
do. We had both replaced our GI Joes with music but to me it became so
much more important and to him I think it was just another fad that'd
he grow out of just like the GI Joes. He just wanted to
get together and
play then go home and watch MTV. I don't think he had any intentions
for anything
more than that. I
don't think he ever had any dream of being on stage, playing original
music, he just wanted to get together in a garage and play Mr.
Brownstone for 3 hours.&nbsp; <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>With all this going on, the
relationships started getting weird in the band and out. Keaton and I
both really cared about doing this music thing but we almost always had
differing views on how to do it. We argued constantly. I listen to
recordings of our practices and we argue between nearly every song
about something meaningless and Mike always stood off to the side with
no real opinion to offer of his own. But
Mike remained my friend and it still felt like it was our band, Keaton
was the outsider
coming in, so when we needed a tie breaker Mike would side with me and
it would up being us two
versus Keaton in
most disagreements. Yet despite this and despite our friendship
outside of the band, our ideas for what we wanted the band to be were
completely opposite
and
frustrating. My relationship with Keaton was completely the
opposite. Outside of the band we were barely friends much of the time
but no matter how up and down and combustible our friendship was, in
the band we knew what we wanted to do and Mike was an anchor slowing us
down.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>I recently found a list of all our songs where I
noted who
wrote each song and I think that list really summed things up. The list
features songs written by Keaton, by Jason, by Keaton and Jason, by
Keaton and Mike, by Jason and Mike, by Keaton, Jason and Mike. The list
does not feature a single song written "by Mike". <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Mike slowly gave in and
we started doing more and more of our own music and less cover songs.
Our early material can only be described as
schizoid. There were a few bands we all absolutely agreed on like the
Black Crowes and Skid Row but for the most part we were very different
in our tastes and as time went on we all further moved into completely
different
musical directions. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Mike basically worshipped at the alter of MTV. When
we eventually played our first show Keaton and I both wore specific
band shirts and Mike was literally wearing a generic
MTV shirt. Any band that came on MTV he was into and if they weren't on
MTV then they were garbage and didn't matter. Guns N Roses and Motley
Crue were his main things but basically any rock band that came on MTV
were his jam. He didn't like anything except that one thing. Most
people have varied taste. Like a guy can love heavy metal but still
like Billy Joel or something. Not Mike. It's this one thing and nothing
shall
interfere. If you dared introduce him to some awesome indie band
or a classic rock band that was from more than 6 months ago he wouldn't
give it the time of day. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>I was also very into much of the same hard rock
stuff as him but I didn't just stop there like he did. I branched out
from
that stuff.&nbsp; I wanted to hear the bands that influenced those
bands. I wanted to consume it all. I wasted most of my life listening
to
The Fat Boys. I had to make up for it. That led to me discovering punk.
GnR, Motley Crue and Skid Row all led me to The New York Dolls, The
Ramones and the Sex Pistols. We all three went to a Skid Row concert
around this time. It was the very same day I got my first Ramones
cassette. All The Stuff (And More) Volume 1. As soon as I heard it I
was floored by it. I rode to the concert with my cassette. Reading the
liner notes and just lovingly carressing it. That night Skid Row played
a whole section of Ramones covers. I came out of that concert a bigger
Ramones fan than a Skid Row fan. (Also the opening band Soundgarden was
pretty neat and signaled another musical change coming.) I would try to
get Mike to listen to this punk stuff. He thought it was just absolute
trash and would blatantly say none of these bands were real bands and
the music wasn't real music. I remember I let him listen to The
Ramones' Let the Punishment Fit the Crime because I thought he'd like
it because it was not a typical Ramones song and his response was "oh,
so they finally tried to write a real song". <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Meanwhile Keaton
was way into Iron Maiden, Aerosmith, Uriah Heap (WTF?) but he was
REALLY into Danzig. Like a lot. All of Danzig, Samhain, Misfits,
anything Danzig. He slowly turned into what could best be described as
Glen Danzig's Mini-Me for a while. It was all
Danzig, all the time. Basically when we started writing stuff, we
had three different styles all meshing to make one giant load of
weird.&nbsp; But we had fun doing it.&nbsp; Sure, in the end we still
felt we were an arena
rock style band and would draw pictures of ourselves playing on a stage
bigger than the Moon, but as we would soon find out, we were
wrong. What to us sounded like arena rock sounded completely
different to other people.Our songs were about silly things like
Cavemen and loving our grandmas.&nbsp; Not about drinking, doing drugs
and banging groupies. </b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Our early hits included awesome metal classics
such as ACBG. Named for the four chords that appeared in the song. We
had the barn burner T.D. Blues. We had Wah Wah The Porn Bird. We had
Caveman. We had The
Grandma Song. We had a heavy metal version of Old McDonald Had A Farm.
We had D because the song was in drop D tuning. We had U Suck, Fly
Droppings, Queer Nation, You Could Learn a Lesson in Manners and many
other fine tunes. Keaton took German in school and one day had a
homework assignment where he had to translate a bunch of sentences from
English into German. He brought the homework to practice with him and
used
all these weird random sentences, such as "I threw the ball today", as
lyrics for a song we dubbed The German Song. We still had a few covers
in our catalog. But looking back they were some really weird choices.
We used to play GnR's version of Live and Let Die. We could've done
much better at other GnR songs. Instead we picked the one with the
orchestra. We also did Faster Pussycat's House of Pain because why do a
fun rock song when you can do a sappy maudlin ballad? We also did a
cover of GnR's Don't Cry with new lyrics that turned it into Don't Die,
a song about a guy wanting to have sex with his dead father. And I kid
you not, this was my mom's idea and she helped write it. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>If you would care to hear any of these super duper
awesome songs, guess what, you can. Here's a bunch of crappy recordings
of a bunch our crappy songs. Of course our lack of equipment shows and
you can't even hear Keaton singing on most of them. If I was going to
pick any songs in particular to suggest I would say Old McDonald, The
German Song and Wah Wah the Porn Bird are probably the three best to
listen to. And best I mean...I don't know what I mean.<br>

</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had the songs now so we
also finally decided we
needed to pick a name. We literally went through every possible name
ever. Every time we'd settle on a name, 2 days later we'd hate it
and start thinking again. Despite my urging the other guys didn't want
to stick with my awesome Thrash Cans name for some odd reason. Maybe
because we weren't thrash, or maybe because it was stupid. I remember
Keaton
coming
over one day and he was all super excited because he thought up the
perfect name for the band. I remember how he said it. Mister...long
dramatic pause...Bation. He spent days, if not
weeks,
trying to convince us to be Mister Bation. We declined. Several times.
This went on and on and on. We just couldn't find a name. So instead
the name found us.&nbsp; <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>We got our report cards at school one day. The
school had graduated to these weird new computer printed report cards
where, apparently, instead of writing their own comments, the teachers
had a
drop down menu of various comments they could choose from to leave
about each student. I received my report card and read the
comments.&nbsp; One in particular caught my eye......</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>"Jason seems lethargic in class."</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Huh? What the piss does THAT mean? I had never
heard the word lethargic in my life but it looked cool. So I showed it
to Mike and I was like what the hell does this mean? Mike pulled out
his report
card.....</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>"Mike seems lethargic in class."</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>We laughed our balls off. We both got the same
comment and neither one of us had any idea what it meant. So we
showed our cards to Keaton. And...</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>"Keaton seems lethargic in class."</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Ok, now this was just ridiculous. Three
different teachers gave all three of us the same comment featuring a
weird word none of the three of us had ever heard before. We raced to a
dictionary. It
absolutely WAS a perfect description of all three of us. It wasn't even
a question. We had our band name. We were Lethargic. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>By now we were in the 11th grade and things seemed
to be going pretty well. We were getting better...in comparison, we had
songs, we had
a name, now we were starting to think about playing shows. We had no
idea how you do such a thing but we were gearing up for
something. And then I got thrown for a complete loop.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Mike and I had the same
math class but we didn't sit
near each other. Before class started he would always come over and sit
in the desk in front of me and talk a little while beforehand. This day
Mike came and sat down and was really happy about something but he
didn't say what. Instead he slowly
scooted his finger across my desk which made a little brrrrrrrrt noise.
While he did this he smiled and whispered "friiiiiiiictiiiooon".&nbsp;
I was very befuddled. Like any normal person would I looked at him like
he
was a total asshole. Yet he did it again. He slowly
brrrrrrrt-ed
his finger across the desk and whispered a long drawn out "friction"
with some goofy ass smile on his face. I asked him what he was
doing. He just did it again. "Friiiiiiiiccctttiiiiioooonnn." He just
kept doing that until he
walked away back to his seat for class to start. I was completely
confused. He never said anything else about it for the rest of the day.
I wouldn't find out what it meant until that evening and I wouldn't
find out from him. Mike had joined another band.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 3 years now Mike had
been in the guitar classes at
high school and one of the other students, Kenny Hendricks, had become
his idol.&nbsp; Kenny Hendricks had a sweet ass mullet, the fuzziest of
peach
fuzz mustaches, a fake gold chain, looked 10 years too old for high
school and played a BC Rich Warlock. To me, he was gross. To Mike, he
was the bee's knees. He had
mentioned Kenny and his band Friction in passing a few times but I
never
really paid much attention. I hadn't heard the band or Kenny play but I
could tell Mike was enamored with it and wished we were more like them.
Once I finally heard
them I understood why. They were a really terrible version of every
fifth rate MTV
hair metal band Mike loved. That's what he wanted to be. A cool MTV
band. Mike was
always obsessed with fitting in and wishing he could be one of the cool
kids. He never could grasp that he was just as big a loser as I was.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>That always felt like a big defining characteristic
in my relationship with both guys. I was never cool and I never tried
to be. Being popular and liked was never my bag. I just wanted to play
drums in my stupid band singing our stupid songs about Old McDonald. I
thought that WAS cool. But at the end of the day I will always just be
the dork with the Voltron posters wanting everybody to eat pizza for
lunch. With
both Mike and Keaton to various extents I always felt like the second
choice. While Mike may have been MY best friend, I never felt I was
his. That was Richard. And if Richard had been more steady at playing
his drums, Mike never would've played with me to begin with. I mean,
dude didn't return a single phone call that whole summer until I left
that dumb note on his door after all. The drums got his attention, not
me. I
was always the
backup plan. If they could find a cooler friend or a cooler band they'd
be gone. They'd almost always eventually come back but they'd at least
give it a shot. It really was like living in an 80s teen comedy where
the dork friend leaves his other dork friends&nbsp; to hang with the
cool kids then ends up coming back in the end. They both desperately
wanted to be the cool guys
but they were just geeks like me and didn't want to admit it. They
wanted to be prom king. I knew that was never going to happen so I'd
rather just play Commodore 64. The difference
between them is that Keaton at least tried. You want to be prom king
you gotta at least go to the prom. Keaton did. I mean, he went with a
lesbian, but still...he went for it. Mike never really tried no matter
how much he wished for it. He just waited for things to fall into his
lap and then stupid Kenny Hendricks did.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>We finished school that day
and went home and practiced like
everything was normal. We practiced at my house so my Mom was
always around and at some point he went off and told HER what the
brrrrrrrrrt finger scoot was about. He didn't tell me, he didn't tell
Keaton. He told her. After practice and everybody left she told me the
big
secret.
Kenny Hendricks asked Mike to join Friction and he did. Had he told me
this to begin with I would've
been disappointed he was wanting to do something else, but not angry.
That my friend didn't have the balls to tell
me himself and instead had my Mom tell me made me much more than
disappointed, I was enraged. What
kind of sackless puss handles it like that? Apparently one that
wants to play in a sackless puss hair metal band. To me being a member
of
Lethargic felt like being a member of The Crips. I wasn't going to go
off and join The Bloods too. Now I knew for sure that Mike didn't feel
the same. But the worst part was I knew my best friend couldn't even
talk to me about the one thing I
thought was the most important thing in both our lives at the time.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>I confronted him about it and he couldn't understand
why I was mad. At all. He acted like I was stupid for being mad. He
couldn't grasp that I wasn't mad that he was playing in both bands, I
was mad that he
couldn't tell me, that he couldn't even tell me it was a discussion or
a
possibility beforehand. He claimed he was going to do both bands and
there would
be no problem at all. My only point was that he could've told me that
to
begin with
instead of brrrrrrrt-ing his finger across a desk and whispering
"friiiiiiiiictioooooon" at me like a weirdo. But maybe it's my fault
for not understanding that coded message.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>We
moved on and a few weeks later it was over. He quit Friction and
came back to us fulltime. I don't know exactly what happened but
much like those 80s teen comedies, the grass isn't always greener, the
geek always comes back. That finger scoot was the
last time he ever seemed happy about getting in that band. It seemed
like it was miserable for him and I think he ended up feeling guilty
about the whole situation. I also think that he figured out that
playing weird
sucky music with your actual friends who just want to have fun is much
better than playing sucky music with people you barely know and who
take themselves way too seriously and expect you to take it seriously
too.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that was settled we
were ready to
debut our silliness to the public but we had no idea how. How do
three underage and immature douche bags book a show or get in a
recording studio or do anything? That's when school stepped in.
Apparently our school put on this concert series every spring called
the Original Music Festival. Anybody who had a band
that performed original music could perform on this show. When we
found out about this we stumbled all over ourselves signing up for
it. Finally! A show! We picked out which songs we
wanted to play (including a cover song for original music fest, of
course) and got to practicing.&nbsp; </b></p>

<p align="left"><b>One of the most embarassing memories of my life
happened the night before the show.&nbsp; We had one last practice and
then we packed up our junk and put it in the van. After we got
done we stayed outside, I sat on that same porch where the GI Joe
incident happened, and we talked about the band and the show and
everything. We talked
about our
expectations on how we'd do, how much people would hate us, would we be
scared and nervous, etc. It was one of the best talks the three of us
had together.
The Friction thing was over and done. We were all finally focused on a
single goal together and felt unified. At one point Mike started
talking about how much he liked
the drums on one of the songs. Then Keaton started praising the drums
on another song. Their praise for me got a little
too overboard and Keaton
realized it so he dropped the sarcastic joke of "you're like the
greatest
drummer in the world, dude". He followed that with a hearty belly
laugh.&nbsp; Me, being a complete dunce, couldn't just laugh along at
the joke. Instead I felt the need to be serious and become a
philosopher and
dropped this little
nugget of wisdom.....</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>"Nah, man, I'm not that good. I feel like, well, we
all three kind of suck really. But when we play together it
works.&nbsp; We just click. It's like magic."</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>It's been decades since that
night. It was a looooong time ago. But I still remember
sitting on that porch. I still remember exactly where Keaton and
Mike stood. I still remember the look of disgust on Keaton's face
after I said it.&nbsp; I remember regretting it before it was halfway
out my mouth. To this day I'll just be sitting around, minding my
own business, and that memory pops into my mind out of the blue and I
turn red in embarrassment. And it'll just stick in my brain like
somebody drove a spike in there.&nbsp; It won't leave.&nbsp; I end up
thinking about it for hours and wanting to shoot myself. The saddest
part is...I really did feel that way. And I still kinda do, not in a
magical way, but I don't think the band would've been nearly
as fun, weird or as unique without one of us. Almost all of the songs
came from the three
of us going in my bedroom and goofing around. One guy would play
something, the other would join, the other would join. We weren't
trying to be what we ended up being. </b><b>Once we did start trying
to be something is when everything fell apart. But at this point the
band </b><b>was
just purely us being us with zero agenda. We weren't Led Zeppelin but
we were something. And as we would see the next night,
nobody else was doing anything like what we were doing.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The night of our big debut
came around.&nbsp; We were
scheduled to play first but a punk band called KY and the Jellies
showed up and jumped on stage to play a song so we ended up
second.&nbsp; The
problem was that one song they did was awesome and everybody loved
it. It was like, great, we just got screwed over on our very
first show by a bunch of weirdos named KY and the Jellies playing only
one
song. Great start to the night!<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left">G<b>etting ready to go out there I noticed something I
didn't expect, I
wasn't really nervous about it. I remember thinking about how I'd
probably be a nervous wreck, but when it came time to do it, I've
rarely been less nervous than that. No matter when you
read this I guarantee that I was more nervous today for some reason
than I was walking on that stage that night. I
was more nervous about surviving the drive there than getting
on the stage. It's weird. When somebody would show up to
watch us practice, I'd be completely thrown off. All of were like that.
I'm still the
same way. If you put me in front of 2 or 3 people I turn into a
statue, if you put
me in front of a whole bunch of people I suppose it doesn't really
matter
anymore. It was the same way years later. Small shows were torture and
bigger crowds were always just fun. My only real worry that night was
that I couldn't use
my own drums, I had to use Friction's drums. I never played a different
drumset before. I didn't even get time to practice or adjust anything.
I just had to go out and play. Once I got there, well, drums are drums
and you just hit them.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>As for the others, Keaton was a little bit anxious
but
trying to hide it, that was understandable as he was the one out
front doing all the talking and singing, but Mike.....poor, poor
Mike......Mike was
quite the nervous nellie. Watching him on stage was <i>hilarious</i>.
You know how Middle Eastern terrorists always release those scary video
tapes of their American hostages reading their demands? Those
hostages look less nervous with a hooded terrorist with a big ass sword
standing behind them than Mike did at a show. Whenever it was time for
him to do a solo he would look away from the crowd
and stand in front of his amp like he was trying to get feedback. But
he wasn't getting feedback. He was hiding. The worst part is that every
time we played, Mike always stood there looking like he was chewing a
big jaw full of bubble gum. But he wasn't. He would
actually get so nervous on stage that he'd stand there chewing on his
own tongue. He looked like a cow chewing cud. It was
weird. One time he showed us his tongue after a show and it was
all bloody. At the end of our first show he would pick his guitar
up and cover his face with it as he walked off stage. What a
creep! The crazier thing is Keaton spontaneously did the same thing.
What a bunch of weirdos. But, anyway, I wasn't nervous. We had low
expectations.
Nobody there cared if we were good or not. Nobody was there for us. We
didn't
have
big heads about what we were doing. We didn't expect people to
like us. We didn't think we were some great band that was gonna
become rich and famous, we were just having fun.&nbsp; </b></p>

<p align="left"><b>And fun we had. As a first show, it went just
about perfect. There were some tiny mistakes of course but nothing
really went wrong at all and the
reaction from the other kids was a bit beyond what we expected. We were
the only band that had a mini mosh pit break out in the middle
of the high school auditorium. It's not that we played well or
our songs were any good, I think it was simply not what anyone
expected. We were completely
different
from anybody else that hit that stage that night and likely any other
night.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b> Honestly, almost every other band that played that
night were total douche bags who were trying way too hard to be serious
and cool. This era was pretty much right around the tail end of
the
hair metal era, just about 5 minutes away from Nirvana shoving
everybody off the mountain. They were on MTV but the album hadn't hit
#1 yet. We had already seen Soundgarden live opening for Skid
Row.&nbsp; In Lethargic practices we
were already fooling around with a couple of Nirvana covers. Sure, we
were still in
that small amount of time where grunge was existing alongside the hair
metal bands, the wave had not completely wiped them out yet, but grunge
had definitely arrived and you could definitely hear that in a couple
of our songs
on this show. WE had gotten the memo that change had arrived. The other
bands did not get that memo. There was no hint of the grunge or
alternative movement that was forming. They
all felt incredibily out of touch with what was happening at the time.
They looked and sounded like old men and their style of music would be
basically totally wiped out within mere months. There were no Alice in
Chains up there, but there were a lot of Trixters.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The band immediately
following us was this totally lame
ass band you might have heard of called Friction. Seeing what
this band was for the first time was jawdropping. THIS was the band
Mike wanted to be in? They were a horrible mish mash of mullets, pink
shirts, BC Rich Warlock guitars, peach fuzz
mustaches, ear rings and awful guitar solos that made no sense, all
dedicating hair metal power ballads to their girlfriends with lyrics
like "Two hearts beating together, two hearts forever and ever."
BLURGGH. Everybody in the band wore white pants which was disturbing.
And in the middle of it all, these idiots have their drummer
do a drum
solo. And not just a drum solo, but a drum solo with a fog machine.
Even WE had grown out of playing with the stupid strobe light at this
point. These dudes still thought a fog machine was cool. The
crowd
snored in excitement! You're playing a high school
douchebag, you're not Tommy Lee. Stop
it. I'd be willing to bet money that Friction's singer drives an
I-Roc Z today. He has to. Being our first time hearing
Friction, Keaton and I, were ab-so-lute-ly laughing our balls off. We
couldn't believe it. We howled in laughter at how terrible this band
was. Mike was so pissed at us and did not join in on the fun. And Kenny
Hendricks? The dude flat out sucked balls. Mike was a way
better guitar player than this guy was. This dude's guitar solos were
just
note salad. Hit as many notes as possible with no melody or flow. Mike
couldn't hit all those notes that fast but all the solos he did made
sense and fit
the song and were musical. Kenny Hendricks made it sound like his
guitar was having a seizure. To cap it all off the three of them all
came to the front of the stage, interlocked arms and took a bow to the
crowd. Why are you bowing you creeps? Here's their big hit "Two
Hearts"...<br>

<p align="left"><b>The real show stopper though was the last band
called Nobody's Chyld. Because Y's are sooooo much cooler than
I's. Spelling names intentionally wrong is always the sign of a true
winner. Originally this band was called something else and they
were really good. I don't remember the name but I am confident it was
better than Nobody's Chyld. They used to play at pep rallies and stuff
and they
were pretty amazing for a bunch of high school kids. Almost as good as
Iron Maiden. But then the guitar player and the singer had some kind of
falling out and the guitar player left the band. Apparently the singer
took full
control then and turned it into the monstrosity known as Nobody's
Chyld. The original lineup had a typical 4 person lineup. Nobody's
Chyld showed up and they had like 8-10 members in the band and
it took them about 30-40 minutes to set everything up. Not only
did they
have all those people and all their equipment, but they had props, a
light show, that damn fog machine again...everything. The guy who led
the band seemed
to believe he was the second coming of Paul Stanley. He was
this self important cockhead who really seemed to think he was destined
for greatness and this glorified high school talent show was the start
of
his
rise to the rock and roll hall of fame.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>And by now hardly anybody was there to witness this
debacle. The place was pretty far from being full in the first place.
The crowd dwindled as the night dragged on. Then the ridiculous amount
of time to set up their equipment cleaned the place out. The effort he
put into this
show for a handful of people was just stupid. We're all stuck
there sitting and watching
him
and his band set up all this equipment and then before they begin, he
walks off stage. Where'd
he go? Oh, he had to put on his rock star costume. We were
just
watching this guy in normal clothes a minute ago, setting up amps like
everybody else and now here he is dressed like Mark Slaughter with no
shirt on and this douchey black and white tiger stripped leather
jacket cut off right below his chest and flapped wide open to show off
his two sexy
young abs. But before they could start playing their awful generic
music they just HAD&nbsp;to
let everybody know just how totally serious they were. These guys
weren't joking around, dammit!&nbsp; They played a tape of Jim Morrison
reading poetry over the PA as an intro as everybody left in the
auditorium just looked
around wondering what the hell was happening. There had already been
interference earlier in the show, including our set, where a religious
radio station started coming through the amps. When this poetry crap
started it just seemed like it was happening again at first. After the
poetry they preceded to
play for what felt like an eternity. It made me long for the good ol'
days of just watching them setup their amps. A never ending
onslaught of awful
fifth rate hair metal power ballads and the only people left watching
was his girlfriend and the people laughing at him. That would be
the Lethargic section.&nbsp; It was one of the funniest and saddest
things I've ever seen.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, back
to US. We went over fairly well because
we were the complete opposite of all this self important garbage. We
weren't
playing that type of music, we weren't really playing music like
anything. We had no real style we were shooting for. We
weren't taking ourselves seriously. We weren't forcing people to
listen to poetry or
stare at our stomachs. We weren't up there acting like we were
starting the next rock and roll revolution. We were playing songs
about Cavemen and Wolfmen instead of girlfriends. Keaton acted
silly while wearing this stupid girls hat with a flower on it. I
couldn't stop smiling
while I was playing
I was so stupid and happy. Mike stood at his amp chewing his
tongue. While Mike soloed, Keaton would sometimes move to the drums
and we'd just laugh at each other, we didn't feel the
need to pose like rock stars and turn on fog machines. We
actually wore the same clothes we showed up in. We just had fun
playing our stupid songs and some people got a laugh out of it. Once we
finished and Friction came on stage with their overbearing
seriousness all the fun between KY's performance and ours drained out
of the room.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>The songs we played were:</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>The Lethargic Song - This was our weird instrumental
intro song that was way longer in practice. We cut it down for the show
and it still felt too long. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>D - Our most grunge song at the time. Like I
mentioned
before, the song was called D because it was written for drop D tuning.
But for
the shows they never even played it in drop D because they didn't want
to have to re-tune for the song. Early on, despite Keaton being the
singer and
all in on writing original material, he rarely wrote lyrics. He always
just tried to improvise the words to every song. So Mike and I wrote
the lyrics for D one day in the school library. We simply took turns
writing
random lines that fit Keaton's melody. We didn't try to make it about
anything it was just my line, your line, my line, your line. After
sitting down and looking them over, for some reason I
felt it had a vampire vibe. So I started lying about it's title and
saying it was named D because we based it on the anime Vampire Hunter
D. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b><span style="font-style: italic;">I feel the power
down inside me<br>

<p align="left"><b>Caveman - Caveman was a song we had forever. One of
our earliest songs. Once again Keaton never wrote any lyrics for it and
we were only a couple weeks out from the show. So I got stoned on
Flintstones chewables and came up with this work of art:</b></p>

<p align="left"><b><span style="font-style: italic;">Why are dinosaurs

<p align="left"><b>Satan's Bride - This was a total Keaton song and
mostly just served as his tribute to Danzig. One of Keaton's
cousins was the guy running the stage lights and stuff that night. So
he added some deep voice backing to Keaton's singing during this one.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>And there it is. Like I said, not all that great,
but people were digging it. People we didn't know were screaming
and yelling. The other bands? The only people screaming at
them were the girlfriends the songs were about. We may have been
complete zeros in the talent department and the popularity department
but we were also a zero in the
not being pretentious douches. I really knew it had gone well when
a couple of weeks later I had to go to a family reunion. My
cousin who lived across town came up and asked me if my band was called
Lethargic. I said...um, yeah, how did you know that? It
turned out, he had heard about how our one stupid little show all the
away
across town and were hearing about the band that created a mosh pit in
the high school auditorium. People across town are talking about us?
They know our name? After one show? This must be what being on MTV
feels like.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of other important
things happened that
night.&nbsp;
First of all, immediately after we played, the guys from KY and the
Jellies came up and asked us to play a show with them at a house
party. Keaton and I looked at each other like WOW and then we
said...US? "You want US to play
at a punk show? But we're not a punk band." They looked at
us like we were mentally challenged and said..."yes, you are". We
looked at
each other again. "We're a punk band?" We agreed to do the
show and went back to tell Mike the good news that 5 minutes after our
first show we already had our second. But when he found out it
was a punk show and people were calling us a punk band, he was not
thrilled. After all, Slash isn't punk!!! The funny thing about
this is that it was all literally Mike's fault. Mike, the one who hated
punk, is the one that caused us to be a punk band. Because he was the
one that made us play Down on the Farm. Down on the Farm was a song by
The UK Subs. A punk band. He didn't know who the hell The UK Subs were.
He didn't care. All he knew was that
Guns N Roses played the song at Farm Aid so he wanted to play it. And
then we played it at an original music fest. The only band that did a
cover song that night. We were the band
that was so punk we defied the school's rules for the show and played a
punk song while doing it. This would be a major screw up on Mike's part.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>I personally thought this moment was
awesome. I still do. Because I always felt like the
original punk scene happened accidentally. It wasn't a bunch of
bands deciding to be "punk" bands. It was a bunch of kids trying
to be themselves and out came punk. And that's sorta how it happened
for
us. We just set out to be a band and we organically found our
calling and morphed into a punk band by accident. Anybody can say
hey, lets start a punk band. It takes way more talent to just
suck bad enough that everybody THINKS you're a punk band. Right? <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Also, later in the show another band called Sturgess
played. They'd later go on to find fame and fortune as Teen
Idols. By now I had begun my descent into becoming a Ramones
fanatic, so seeing these guys for the first time was a real eye
opener. It was just leather and blue jeans and t-shirts and
short, fast, simple catchy songs. They looked sorta like the
Ramones, they sorta sounded like the Ramones and they were only a year
or two older than we were. Being somebody coming so late to not
only the music party but to the punk party, it suddenly dawned on
me...why can't we be more like this? The answer of course was
Mike, but the fact that we weren't as talented as them should also be
taken into consideration. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our second show was a total
180 from the first
show. There was no leaving happy this time. Every bit of
momentum died. It was completely demoralizing and embarrassing.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Since we were
gonna be playing at a "punk" event we decided to not play the majority
of the
songs from the school thing because most were slow. We put
in all of our more up tempo songs so we'd be more PUNK. We showed
up expecting to play another 20 minute set but once we arrived we were
told that we were supposed to
play for an hour. AN HOUR. No, hold on, not just one hour. They wanted
us to
play for an hour, then KY would play for an hour and then they wanted
us to play again...for another hour. WHAT? We just played in
front of people for the
first time and now we're supposed to play a Springsteen concert. This
started feeling like some kind of Carrie trick where we'd get pig
blood dumped on us as we launched into our second set. We showed up
expecting to play 5 songs or so and that's all we had been
practicing. Now we're in a panic trying to think of other songs we
could do off the top of our heads that wouldn't be too embarassing.
Plus we
were playing outside on a patio which seemed weird. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>We played our first
set and it
was a total downer. This was KY's party and this was KY's
friends and they were there to see KY, they were not there to put up
with our goofy non-sense that wasn't nearly as punk as
advertised. We sorta knew 3 or
4 people there at most and they were all the members of KY. We had zero
friends in
that crowd. Nobody cared. Nobody wanted to hear us. There was ZERO
energy. It was like we showed up and started playing at a funeral. We
played, people stared at us, we stopped, polite applause.&nbsp;
Rinse.&nbsp; Repeat.&nbsp; For an hour. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>After we get done, KY plays and
everybody
loves it. The place goes bonkers. They end their set, turn it back over
to us
and then they go inside the
house.&nbsp; I repeat. They went inside the house. These were the guys
throwing
the party. These were the guys everybody was there to see. Obviously
nearly
everybody else there went inside the house with them. So
there we are playing our crappy music outside some strangers house with
literally 4 or 5 people left out there watching us. I </b><b>specifically
</b><b>remember this one girl with green hair and a nose ring
sitting there watching us and politely applauding. I kept looking at
her and it was like I could read her mind. It felt obvious to me that
she didn't want to be there either but she knew what an awful situation
we were in so she stayed to be nice. I wish I knew who that girl
was so I could send her a thank you card. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>This situation really
had us in a dilemma now. </b><b>Why are we even following these stupid
rules? Nobody is paying us for this. If we don't play for a full hour,
who's gonna complain? </b><b>So do we keep playing or do we just admit
defeat
and give it up? It's only 4 or 5
people, but it's not ZERO people. The nice girl is there after all, but
maybe
we should let her go enjoy the party instead of testing the level of
her patience? Well, it sucks to be polite because we forged
right
ahead and played and she was stuck outside watching us labor through
god awful song after god awful song instead of being inside with the
cool
punk kids.&nbsp; </b></p>

<p align="left"><b>This show isn't just
noteworthy because it was our
worst show so far, but because it was the first of several onstage
fights between Keaton and I. Since we were trying to drag the
set out, Keaton decided on the spot for us to play a cover of Twist and
Shout we
had been goofing around with. I didn't think we
should do it. I was ready to go home. We had been embarrassed enough
for one
night. We didn't really play the song, we just goofed with it in jam
sessions while Keaton made up lyrics to a song he didn't actually know.
And it was such a goofy song. Twist and Shout? This is the song we're
gonna
pull
out of our ass to impress the polite green haired punk girl putting up
with us? Really? Twist and Shout? Looking back now? Why was it worth
fighting over? Just play
the song you trollish little dork, the night wasn't going to
get any worse. But no, I was pissed over the whole situation and
felt like fighting. So we had those 4 or 5 people sit there
watching the two of us argue for what felt like 15 minutes while Mike
just stood there and chewed on his tongue. Finally we played
Twist and Shout and then we quit. I would like to say we quit and went
home but nope. We still had to wait for our ride to come get us. So now
literally everybody went inside, leaving us totally alone outside
standing in the driveway watching for my parent's cool minivan to come
take us home. We were officially no
longer happy
to be a punk band and quite embarrassed by the whole ordeal.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Yet even after all that happened during the
show...the worst part was probably my
choice of attire. I was almost immediately going against everything I
thought worked about the first show. I was trying to be cool and forgot
I was the Voltron poster dumbass. This was a PUNK show so I figured
I couldn't
just be myself. Being ourselves seemed to work for our first show,
so why repeat that? Keaton just put on a Misfits shirt
and wore the same stupid girl hat that he wore for the first
show. Me? I didn't have a funny hat so
I came up with a brilliant idea. I'd wear my Ramones shirt but
I'd take a clip on tie and clip it on the t-shirt. WHOA!!! Look
out!!&nbsp; This guy is crazy!!!!!!&nbsp; He's got a tie on his
T-SHIRT!!!!! On the way over I held my tie in my hand. When
we
got to the house...oh boy, it's showtime! I clipped on my tie and
jumped out of the van, saw the other kids and immediately realized what
a horrible,
horrible, horrible decision this was. Oh, look over there, it's a
guy with 2 foot tall purple liberty spikes. Oh, look over there,
it's
a guy with a bone going through his nose. Sure, I'll fit right in
these with punk rock savages as long as I'm wearing my clip on
tie! Every
fiber of my being wanted to take the tie off in shame, but I had
already been seen, taking it off in front of people would be even worse
than
wearing it to begin with. But I'm pretty sure it didn't even last
through the first hour set. I kept it on until I knew the show was down
the drain. Once I knew nobody gave a crap about us anyway I ditched
it. But
the embarrassment has never been ditched. It lives in my soul forever.</b></p>

<p align="left"><u><b>Chapter Three</b></u></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last show didn't go
well but after getting these
two shows under our belt, Keaton and I got a bit more serious.&nbsp;
Not serious enough to practice hard or stop arguing, but serious in
that we saw potential for something. By potential I
don't mean we had dreams of signing a big record deal and touring the
world and making money doing it but I think we both certainly felt that
we could get this thing to a point where we should be able to play more
shows without leaving embarrassed. We started going to more all ages
punk shows and seeing other bands so it was like, why don't we do this
too?<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>We also both felt that what we were doing (writing
literally anything we came up with and
playing it) wasn't going to fly. It might work at one high school
talent show, but what club would book a band that sounded like
that? We wanted to put more effort in trying to sit down and
write songs instead of always just jamming and seeing what fell out and
we definitely wanted to start focusing our music in a more "punk"
direction. Both Keaton and I were way into the Ramones by now and he
was all on The Misfits because of Danzig.&nbsp; Our
musical tastes were changing, why shouldn't OUR music reflect
that? Oh yeah, Mike. He wanted no part
of it. Luckily, we got some help from Seattle.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Grunge officially took over the world and Nirvana
was everywhere. All of a sudden all those
guitar rock videos were gone and MTV was Nirvana all day and all
night.&nbsp; So what happened?&nbsp; Mike found a new MTV band to
love. I grew to love Nirvana too, but at the start I hated it. I was a
little slow to join the whole grunge train. Keaton never really cared
for
them. But the fact that Mike was obsessed with them was great news for
us. He kept wanting to play more and more Nirvana songs so we obliged
as much as we could. Nirvana was just a punk band under a different
made up genre name. So now
all of a sudden Mike was happy to play punk songs just because somebody
told him it was grunge. Mike had tricked himself yet
again. This opened the door
for us to start pushing in Ramones, Misfits and Damned covers.&nbsp;
Keaton started writing faster songs. Mike eventually started
helping him.&nbsp;We never really did go all the way full punk style
though, we still
liked our variety, or couldn't help ourselves, whichever you prefer. So
while most of our songs were now moving in that
direction, we still kept in some more rock-oriented stuff and goofy
stuff and slower stuff to break up the monotony of the ol' three chords
and a cloud of dust routine.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>During this timeframe we actually put in a little
effort to try to record ourselves playing our songs as best we could.
It didn't work out so well but we tried. A little bit. We put these
crappy boombox recordings together and named it Lethargic: The
Cassette. I mean, we didn't sell it or anything, who would buy it, but
we had it. It definitely shows we were still scatterbrained and all
over the place even though we thought we were being punk. The Cassette
still featured our dumb cover of Faster Pussycat's House of Pain and
even though it was edited there are still many instances of Keaton and
I yelling at each other.</b></p>

</b></p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhere during this time
period Keaton's cousin decided
he wanted to try joining the band as the new bass player and let Keaton
focus on
singing or possibly playing 2nd guitar. The thing was, Keaton's
cousin was like 30 years old. On one hand it seemed like a
cool idea to have an older established guy that we figured knew what he
was doing
and would be a much better bass player, on the other hand it seemed
kinda odd. Why does this old dude want to play with some 15/16
year olds? Seemed kinda weird. At one point he said what made him want
to play with us is that we were so "punk" to play a UK Subs song at the
school show. Mike screwed himself again! I remember breaking it to him
that we had no idea who the UK Subs were and we only played it because
of GnR. He said it was still cool. I didn't believe him.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b> I
believe the experiment lasted one practice. Maybe two. Because the
old dude stunk. He certainly didn't bang the crap out of the bass
the way Keaton did, but he also had the musical timing of throat
cancer. It was terrible. We....the idiot who chews his tongue on
stage....the idiot who wore a clip on tie....the idiot who couldn't
remember a single lyric....WE....decided that WE didn't want to play
with
the grown ass man who had been playing a decade or more in several
local
bands. We had enough timing problems with our terrible drummer,
we didn't need an even crappier bass player too.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>But the one moment that stands out about that one
practice is yet another douchey moment in my life. Another top
ten terrible memory. After practice, Mike and Keaton left and his
cousin hung out a while to talk with me about bass and drums and timing
and
punk. We ended up talking about how Keaton sang. I was saying
I wish he'd use more emotional range in his voice, he kinda just either
yells
or yells like Danzig. There's not many peaks or valleys. Then I had to
come out with another one of my "like magic" type
statements. At that time I had a bunch of pictures of bands on my
walls cut out of rock and metal magazines. One of these was a
picture of Sebastian Bach, with no shirt on of course. I looked
up at the picture and said "I wish Keaton was more like Sebastian Bach.
He
can sing ballads, he can sing rock, he can sing punk, he's pretty much
the best singer ever." The whole time I'm saying this, I'm staring
at the picture. I am lovingly looking at Sebastian Bach's naked, sweaty
chest and waxing poeticly about how he's the greatest singer to ever
live. The guy says
NOTHING in reply. He just leaves me hanging there and I'm still
staring at the picture like I want to suck Sebastian's balls. It was
possibly the gayest moment of my life. The
silence was defeaning and I immediately wanted to die. Pretty sure that
was
the last conversation I had with Keaton's cousin for years.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We finally had our first
"real" show at Lucy's
Record Shop. Lucy's was the local all ages punk record store, music,
club, general hangout place that magically showed up at the perfect
time in our lives. We may have never had a show again if this place
didn't enter our lives. It had a stage and everything! No crowd,
but a stage. The show wasn't very memorable. It went OK. Some of the
stuff went over well, some didn't. Probably because we were still so
schizo. We mostly bounced back and forth between uptempo punky songs
and slow grungey songs. As soon as people were starting to get into it
and move around we would decide to settle everybody back down with a
nice slow number
and everybody would turn back to statues. But even as mediocre as it
was
Keaton and I had fun playing another show and Mike
chewed his tongue. His nervousness was really starting to
cause problems and it seemed to get worse with each show instead of
better. He would
sometimes completely forget songs and have to
ask Keaton to show him how they went on stage. Sure, Keaton forgot
about
half the words but he could fake that and make up new ones, you can't
make up guitar chords. There would be songs he was supposed to start
but forget
how they went so Keaton would start it on the bass instead. Mike would
point at him like "oh yeah, that's it" and then start playing. He
was a bit of a train wreck on stage. And it was frustrating because he
was so good. He could play stuff on guitar I can still only dream of,
but
put him on
stage and it was a crap shoot. Here are
some mediocre videos of that mediocre show, not the entire show but
it's enough. Probably too much. Also, the full audio.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the band wasn't
perfect, it at least seemed to
be headed in a better direction. The only problem was that my
personal relationship with Keaton was always up and down and it was
only
getting worse and worse. The simplest way to describe why the two
of us could never truly get along is easy. When I am told to be
somewhere at 7 I actually try my best to get there by 7, hopefully a
few minutes early to
be on the safe side. When Keaton was told to be somewhere at
7 he might get there at 7 but it might be at 7:30, 8, 10 or three
weeks later without any communication to let you know he's still alive.
He was a completely unreliable person. I'm the type of person that when
I commit to doing something it means I have every intention of doing
it. Look at this web
page. I committed to make this and look how long it is
already and I'm not even out of high school yet. Keaton was the type of
person that would commit to
something, but get distracted by a shiny object on the floor.
That shiny object was usually a person. He was only a friend when
nobody
cooler was available. Anytime somebody he deemed "cool" came
calling he'd drop Mike and I in a snap only to come dragging back
later on and be completely unaware of how he had just stabbed us in the
back and have NO IDEA why we were mad that our singer had vanished
for days or weeks. That thing with Friction and Mike?
That was a shock because I truly didn't expect it from Mike.
With Keaton? A Friction moment always either felt on the verge of
happening. And at least Mike did that thing with his finger. Keaton
would just be gone with no communication at all.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>I swear, in the last year or so of&nbsp; this
band's existence we must've kicked Keaton out of the band at least 20
times. My favorite was the time he showed up about 2 hours
late for practice. We were so fed up with him by time that we&nbsp;
tossed all his equipment out on the porch and practiced without him. So
he shows up, comes up to the porch to
see all his stuff, can hear us playing without him and knocks on the
door. Because I knew how much it pissed ME off to have to hear
Mike joined Friction from my Mom, I had her answer the door and tell
Keaton that we kicked him out. LOL! What a hypocrital asshole!
Listening to her tell us
about how sad he was as he picked up his stuff made me very happy. I
mean, we knew full well that he would be back, but making him have to
carry all his
crap back home, then bring it all back, hearing us playing on without
him, priceless.
There were other times where we'd kick him out at the start of a school
day and by time school was over, we'd let him back. While we didn't get
along personally a lot of the time
we more or less got along great on what we wanted to do with the music.
The band
started as Mike and Jason...with Keaton. It was slowly turning into
Keaton and Jason...with Mike. The
other problem was that there was nobody else. If we kicked him
out for real, it's
just Mike and Jason again and I wasn't ready to go back to being that.
I
wanted to keep on doing what we were doing and I needed
Keaton for that. With Mike, it'd just turn back into doing
covers all the time. I also mistakenly had too much faith that
it would all work out in the end and Keaton would grow out of it. I
felt
he was
talented and it frustrated me that he sometimes put more effort into
being a jerk
than he put into the music. It still frustrates. Not much has
changed.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main reason the last
year or so of the band
got so much more volatile and Keaton got so much more annoying and
flighty was that it had begun
dating what I will refer to only as...THE THING. THE THING was
a creepily skinny girl who was even more obsessed with Danzig
than he was. What they call in the business...a crazy
chick. One of those people who'll sit around writing poetry about
killing themselves but doesn't have the guts to just do it and give the
rest of us a break from her nauseating whinging. She was so dark,
maaaaaaaan. If it wasn't for
Keaton, THE THING would've
been the most irritating person on Earth. She wasn't even a hot crazy
chick, she just had the crazy part. Her personality was the typical woe
is
me,
everything is awful, the world sucks, I'm gonna kill myself attention
whore. She'd threaten to kill herself at the drop of a hat just
to get some attention. One time towards the end of their relationship
Keaton tried to break
up with her at school. She threw a fit and pulled out a knife. She said
she was going to kill herself and ran off. Did she? Of course not. She
just wanted people running all over the school trying to find her and
save her. And of course, Keaton took her back. The ol' "I'm gonna kill
myself" gag worked every
time. It was soooooo tiresome. Keaton started bringing THE THING to
practice so the
rest of us had to put up with it. Mike and I hated her. It was like a
dark cloud was constantly in the house.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>But the worst part of THE THING is that THE THING's
personality infected Keaton. Keaton became exactly like
her for a while. All of a sudden, our goofy friend went from
happy go lucky fun guy
to mopey depressed irritable emo cocksucker. He started
having mood swings like he was going through menopause.
Everything got really weird for a while. Mike and I would
be sitting around watching TV or playing video games, having fun, stuff
that Keaton used to enjoy as well, but now he would just sit there with
THE THING all wrapped up in each other's arms and legs not saying
anything, just looking mean and pissed and dark. Sometimes we see
Keaton would snap out of it right in front of our eyes but THE THING
would drag him back down into her pit of despair. They were Sid and
Nancy without heroin. I wish they would've had the
heroin because then it all would've made way more sense.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>The two's unhealthy obsession with Danzig was
leading Keaton to start singing even more like him and looking like him
and acting
like him.&nbsp; and practices, when they actually happened, became
slugfests. Keaton's mood swings would send him into fits of
violence out of nowhere. We'd be playing and suddenly his
microphone would go whipping past my head. I remember one time he
threw something at me and I got so pissed that I picked up a cymbal and
threw it at him like Tron.&nbsp; t missed unfortunately.
If it
HAD connected I'd probably still be in prison but at least I'd still
have a head LOL. Another day we were in my room after
practice. In the room there was a bed and a big comfy chair next to it.
There was only a little bit of space between the chair and bed. I
was sitting on the bed, Keaton and THE THING in the chair. Getting up I
triped and slipped into the crack between the bed and
chair a little bit. As I
was
getting up again, Keaton thought it would be funny to jump up out of
the
chair and push me down into the crack and then sit on me to keep me
trapped in it for a few minutes. When he
finally got up he was laughing his ass off like a school girl. I was
not. I was sick
and tired of this crap. I got
up and headed toward him, picking up my drum sticks on the way.&nbsp;
When I grabbed the sticks I heard him say, and I somehow remember this
exact
quote: "OH SHIIIIIIII..." and ran.&nbsp; But he only got to the living
room. I went to hit him in the face with the sticks but he put
his arm up and took a hard whack to the forearm which lead to
a scar that was literally there for years. He yelped and grabbed
his arm which gave me the chance to catch him, pick him up and body
slam
him Hulk Hogan style. I then sat my fat ass on his chest and
started punching him. Mike just sat there watching for a minute
letting Keaton take it a bit before getting up to pull me off. THE
THING just watched with the same pointless, far away, dumb ass look
she always had. Of course, in the end this all just ended up with
us laughing about it. (I laughed even harder seeing Keaton
show up at school with the arm wounds the next day.)&nbsp; his turned
out to be
something we needed. Like I said, we laughed about it the next day. I
think it finally showed Keaton what a prick he
was becoming and things seemed to get better for a while. He
still wasn't punctual or reliable, but THE THING's personality finally
started going away and the real Keaton started coming back. To be fair,
she would also go on to seem like a much better person to hang out with
in my little interaction I had with her in the following years. Perhaps
they both infected each other.<br>
</b></p>

<u><b>Chapter 4</b></u>
<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhere around this time
we managed to get our hands on a
4-track. We were all in a song writing class at school now called
Music Theory and
the school had an old 4-track tape recorder that they would loan to
kids
to record on. And yes, it is absurd that we actually took a song
writing course and this is what we learned. We didn't really do a whole
lot in that class. This was an off shoot of&nbsp; string band class,
which I was also in by now, and much like that class it was mostly just
an excuse for burnout, potheads, metal heads and the like to hang out
together in a wretched hive of scum and villainy.
Even one of the string band teachers, Mr. Pearcy, was known to hang out
behind the school and smoke pot with some students. Pretty sure I
heard he got fired a couple years after we graduated. He was known as
the "cool" string band teacher, the other one was known as a complete
asshat that everybody made fun of. He was named Mr. Satterwhite. The
highlight
of that class was the day one of the burnouts pulled his pecker
out and pissed in Satterwhite's coffee. He got kicked out of the class.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Another highlight in that class, for us, was when
Mr. Pearcy loaned us that
4-track. We were all excited about getting to make some sorta legit
recordings of our songs instead of only being able to record on a
boombox. Yet once it came time to record Keaton pulled one of his
vanishing acts leaving Mike and myself alone to ponder our life choices
and wonder what to do now. We ended up recording some stuff on our own.
Some original instrumentals. Some cover songs. The most memorable one
was when he wanted to record Junkhead by Alice in Chains. Despite how
poorly I played and recorded the drum part, he put in way too much
effort
trying to get the guitar and bass parts right. He was really proud of
himself at the time. But then we had no singer to finish the song off.
After talking about what we should do I was like screw it, I'll sing
it. He didn't think I could do it. The nerve of him! I said sure I can.
Surely singing is not that hard. I mean, I've never tried to sing
anything in my life but how hard could it be? And Alice in Chains? Who
couldn't sing that? EASY. I'll just go in there and knock this thing
right out of the park.<br>
<br>
So I marched into my room to record it but once I had a microphone in
my
hand all that confidence went right out of my ass. The idea that people
in the next room would hear me trying to sing for the first time with
no music behind me was not really something I was into. Suddenly I went
from being cocky to deciding I have to pretend I wasn't actually
serious about this. So I hit record. And ruined all of his hard work.
He was not happy. He could hear everything I was doing through the door
and from what I was told he was flipping the piss out. Once he heard
the final product he still didn't appreciate my artistic vision for the
song. Not even the Ren and Stimpy references. He got all mad and
went home. Later on we recorded a cover of GnR's You Ain't The First.
That features a group vocal so we both had to sing on it together.
Once he started singing and realized how terrifying it was he
wasn't so mad about the Junkhead thing.</b></p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Keaton eventually showed up. Despite all our plans to record so many
songs, he was only there long enough to record 5 measly songs and then
vanished again. The sad thing is that using a 4-track didn't really
help all that much. We had no mics for the drums so they still had to
be recorded on the boom box then transfered to the 4 track. At the end
of the day, having the drums still recorded that way just to led to the
whole still just sounding like our crappy boombox recordings except
that you could hear the vocals better.<br>

TRACK!</a><br>
</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The good thing is that we rehearsed
at my house so the 4-track stayed with me. Since it was going to waste
with the band not
using it, I decided I'd put it to use myself. The stuff I did with Mike
was horrible, but it was a total blast to make and I couldn't get
enough of
doing it and wanted to do more.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>But I didn't really know how
to play guitar at this point. I tinkered and fiddled with it
whenever I had the chance but I had zero idea what I was doing. For a
long time Iused to lay the guitar flat on my lap and only use my thumb
to hold
down one string and slide it around. Even once I started holding it
right, I was mostly just transferring what I knew about bass and was
just
playing the guitar as a bass, one string at a time, no chords. As I
said before, at this point I had
joined the string band class hoping to learn guitar. Unfortunately
the class was split into two groups. For half the year you would be
with Mr. Pearcy and learn guitar. For the other half you'd be with Mr.
Satterwhite and learn mandolin. At this point I had only been with
Satterwhite learning the mandolin. I became pretty decent at mandolin
and I found it to be pretty fun. I was easily the best in my class
because the others guy did nothing but try to gas the place out. The
mandolin players practiced in a small hallway. The other guys in class
would come in every morning and try to fart up the hallway. I was
amazed at how they always had farts loaded in the chamber and ready to
go every single morning and that they always managed to smell so bad.
Satterwhite used to try to laugh along but I don't know how he took it.
He used to try to explain to them that they should eat more fruit
because then it wouldn't smell so bad. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b> But learning how to play mandolin and have better
smelling farts did
me no good in this situation. I still didn't really know guitar much.
The sad part is that even if I HAD been
in Pearcy's guitar class it wouldn't have done any good either.
Satterwhite was the serious teacher. He taught me how to play mandolin.
Pearcy was the "cool" teacher. He didn't teach me anything. He was busy
just hanging out and chatting up the underage girls. SOMETIMES he would
hang out with us newbies, but not
often. All he did was give us acoustic guitars with plastic strings,
take roll call and
let us sit there picking at them on our own for an hour a day.
Literally the only thing I learned in that class was one extremely
basic guitar scale. I still got an A. Ya know, looking back on things,
I think everybody was wrong. I think Satterwhite was the cool one.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I still wanted to
record more. I figured I
know the drums, I'm getting good enough
at bass, all I gotta do is figure out that guitar thing and I can
record all by myself. Mike left his guitar stuff so I picked up the
guitar
and started
trying to bang out some tunes. I had been getting guitar magazines that
had bands in them that I liked. One was an all punk issue and it had
guitar
tablature for a few Ramones songs. I used those tabs to teach myself
how to actually play guitar a little and my first recordings on my own
were
covers of Commando and Pinhead.&nbsp; Now that I knew kinda sorta knew
bar chords, I was ready to go. I started writing my own songs<span style="font-style: italic;">. </span>I
ended up writing and recording a whole cassette full of songs. I was
staying up late into the night writing and recording all that I could.
Many of them were
so late at night that my parents were in bed so instead of using my
drums I had to use the awful drum sounds from my little cheap Casio
keyboard. My vocals were already bad enough and now it's late at night
so I'm just whispering them into the mic. I also learned very quickly
that when you can't sing, putting your mic through a distortion pedal
is a good trick. Hell, on one song I sang through a wah pedal.
The song Monkey Boy turned out to be my big hit and that went on to be
the first Lethargic song that I had written by myself. We were
only supposed to have the 4-track for a weekend but I kept it for two
weeks. Being exposed to that 4-track was mind altering. I can only
assume that this is what it must feel like to do mushrooms for the
first
time. The universe expanded. My mind was open to the Gods of bad music.
My idea of what was
possible had changed. I can write my own songs? I can record them by
myself? I don't have to fight or compromise my ideas? I can do it all
alone? This. Is. Awesome.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>And, yes, if you think you can take it, you can try
to listen to it. There's 24 songs up there. All various levels of
terrible. Commando, Pinhead, Sniff Some Glue, I Wanna Be Sedated are
all my Ramones songs I tried. Junkhead and You Ain't The First covers
with Mike are up there. So is Nirvana's Polly. That one was after I had
been singing for a few days so I did better on it than Junkhead. Monkey
Boy I'll talk more about later. The second biggest hit from this stuff
was Spooky Fruit. I don't know why but Keaton loved it and wanted the
band to play that one. Even when we were adults. We luckily never did
but we came way too damn close.<br>

YOUR MIND!</a><br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The song writing class
would come in even more handy
soon. That high school across town that my cousin went to was
considered our sister school. Our school ended up with all these extra
music
classes, their school ended up having a recording studio class. So
the string band, the concert band, the jazz band, all these different
classes would go over there to record in the studio. Our music theory
class had a
contest. Everybody who wanted to win a free trip to the
recording
studio was to turn in some sort of recording of themselves and the
teachers
would pick who got to go. Well, guess what, we had 5 songs we just
recorded
on the school's 4 track. We're in. And as luck would have it, we were
the only ones. We were
the only people that turned in ANYTHING for the contest. In all honesty
I think Keaton and myself were the only
two in that
class who ever took it seriously and did much of anything. We
were there because of our legitimate interest in
song writing. Everybody else was a bunch of pot head metal guys
looking for an easy grade. Even the other kids who were in bands didn't
really do much but use it as a hangout spot. So being the only entrant
in the
contest we somehow managed to win.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>So now we finally had another goal that got
everybody's
attention focused back on the band and making practice a
priority. I mean, at that point in time, getting a free trip to a
recording studio was huge. Especially to three idiots like us
that had no shot at doing it any other way. I don't think the
idea of getting into a recording studio ever even entered our wildest
dreams. How would we do that? How would we pay for it? Don't you have
to be on a record label for that? This wasn't the
day of
simple to use digital multi-trackers or PC based recording
programs. This was huge. We didn't care we were only going because they
needed bands for the recording studio class to practice on. It turned
out that the recording student who won the unlucky lottery and got to
engineer our session
was the guitar player from Teen Idols, the band that also
played at the Original Music Fest.&nbsp; Circle of life, man.&nbsp;
Circle of life.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>We got to record 4 songs. Three of the choices
were pretty easy to make. For the first two we picked Black Death Vodka
and Overdrive. These were two of our newer punk songs and were easily
the most liked songs in our arsenal. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Black Death Vodka was a Vodka that Slash had an
endorsement deal with back in the day. It had this cool bottle with a
skull wearing a tophat on it's label and it came inside a black wooden
coffin. We HAD to have this cool vodka that Slash liked so I got my
parents to buy it. They drank it. We filled it with water and used it
as a
prop for band photos and stuff. BDV ended up getting banned in the U.S.
for a while so a few years ago I made a pretty penny selling off the
coffin and
bottle on eBay. Somehow Black Death Vodka became so important to our
band that Mike and Keaton wrote this song about it. But when I say the
song is about Black Death Vodka I mean really it's not about anything
but he yells Black
Death Vodka in the chorus for no reason. I mean, look at the lyrics:</b></p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Bitches screw and so do you</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">So you're a bitch well whoop de doo</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

that</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Leaves are green you make me sick</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

</span></p>

<p align="left"><b>Yep. That's the lyrics. They seemed cool at the time
I suppose and Keaton sang them very earnestly. Yes, we were in a song
writing class and this is what we came up with.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>The second song Overdrive was a total Keaton song.
It was basically just an excuse for him to try to sing like Glenn
Danzig. It's lyrics were also quite the doozy:</b></p>

Just another cup of reality<br>
You try to rock and you try to roll<br>
Just let the music fill your soul<br>
You got nine lives so ya might as well play<br>
Can you find the place behind your eyes<br>
Free yourself and take a ride<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Whoa Gonna

Listen to me and drink a cup<br>
Black Death Vodka will fill you up<br>
Drink it straight if you're a man<br>
Shove it up in ya and out again<br>
So don't turn to me cause I don't care<br>
You tell me tell you truth and I tell you dare<br>
Drink it straight and take a chance<br>
Life's too short and it won't last <br>
Whoa Gonna send you into Overdrive</span><br>

<p align="left"><b>Yep, both songs mentioned Black Death Vodka. We sure
were into that bottle of water we had. In the coming years I would also
write a song called Black Death Haunted House and Keaton would write
Black Death Cigarettes. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The third song was a
totally departure from the other songs. We were still a bit
scatterbrained with our songs and Little Off Dead </span><b>is
probably the only
time you can actually tell that the three of us were huge Black Crowes
fans. I think it's probably fairly certain that this is, by far, our
best, most legit song we ever did. And a lot of effort went into it's
recording. The other three songs only had one guitar track with the
solos
added in later. Little Off Dead was the only one where Mike did
multiple guitar parts, both electric and acoustic. He recorded two
different guitar solos and they were mixed together into one. On top of
that we had huge backup with Mr. Pearcy adding dobro and mouthharp
while Janell from Teen Idols added backup vocals. It
was quite the production and came out awesome. Even the lyrics for this
one aren't that embarrassing. They aren't good and they don't make
sense but
they are lightyears better than "pink elephants fly and you are fat":</b></p>

</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>I mean. Yeah. Yeah. Not great. I still like them
though. They
make no sense. But at least they seemed to have a theme and tried to
tell some sort of something. I don't know. For US they were good. In
context. At the time Keaton was super proud of these lyrics and thought
they were his magnum opus. He thought they were so great that when
there was a NATION WIDE poetry contest he entered these lyrics. When he
didn't win he was legitimately angry at the balls of these people to
not pick Little Off Dead. I found it hilarious he thought these lyrics
were that good. I also thought it was pretty ridiculous to think a
school contest would pick one mentioning cocaine.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>The fourth song was the big argument. Keaton wanted
to
record Wolfman. Mike and I wanted to record literally any other song
in the world besides Wolfman. We hated Wolfman. Wolfman was just one of
the really silly songs we came up with in the earlier days that
should've fallen to the wayside along with Caveman and Satan's Bride.
But Keaton loved Wolfman to
an
irritating and perplexing degree. He thought it was our Freebird. I
always thought it was a really terrible version of Green Jelly's Three
Little Pigs song. Keaton always put his foot down and insisted it had
to be included in
everything we ever did all the way to the bitter end. It's the only
song that we played from the
first show to the last. I never understood it and I still don't. A
couple of years later the band was over and Keaton was in college. He
was able to host the college radio station a couple of times. His first
night he kept saying "the metal hour is coming up and we're gonna kick
it off with a local band" and I knew immediately who that band would
be. I
was assuming Black Death Vodka was coming up. Instead the METAL hour
kicks off with stupid ass Wolfman. Then after the song he asked
listeners to call in and vote smash or trash. He only got 4 votes and
it was a tie. So he spent the entire hour trying to get somebody else
to call in and vote and split the tie. Eventually he announced somebody
else finally called and that Wolfman had won the poll. I still don't
believe
him. Keaton hosted that radio station for a total of 4 hours and
managed to play all 4 of our studio songs on the air.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">And for a song he
loved so much, he never bothered to actually write lyrics for it. He
had a handful of lines he always used at the start. The entire song was
basically "I got hair on my nose, I got hair my feet, I got hair on my
whatever". He's a wolfman, get it? But after those first few lines he
had in
the barrel, the rest of the song was always improvised by looking
around the room and saying things he saw. In the second verse of this
studio version he sings the lyric "I got hair on my plan...tee". I kept
wondering what the hell that meant. It turned out that there had been a
plant in the recording studio. So he tried to sing "I got hair on my
plant". But in the middle of singing that he realized it wasn't going
to fit the melody so he just added an extra "tee" on the end and made
up a word. Apparently there were no second takes during this recording
session. The whole Wolfman thing was
just so ridiculous. BDV and Overdrive came out good, Little Off Dead
came out great, and then we had this idiotic Wolfman song. And things
would soon get even worse when it comes to Wolfman but we'll get there
in a
minute. First, here are these four studio songs...</span><br>

<p><b><u>Chapter 5</u></b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guy who booked the bands to play at
Lucy's Record Shop, Donnie, also ran a local punk fanzine called House
O'
Pain. As luck would have it, a little while after going into the
recording studio, HoP was
putting out a 7 inch compilation of local punk bands and was looking
for 4 bands for
it. OMG, we were just in the studio, we have songs recorded...this
is awesome. What great timing! We decided to submit a song, the only
question was which song should it be. Little Off Dead was the best one
but since this was a punk fanzine thing it seemed obvious it should be
either Overdrive or Black Death Vodka.
OBVIOUSLY. I mean, right? Overdrive was the shortest and fastest. Most
punk. Seemed the best choice. Obviously. Well, it wasn't obvious to
Keaton. The only
choice to him was
Wolfman. Once again he became obnoxiously hard headed and stubborn
about this
stupid ass song. He wouldn't take no for an answer. It had to be
Wolfman.
It was such an idiotic decision. The other bands on this compilation
were legitimately
good bands with good songs and fan followings. We were going to be
getting played next to a band named Cannibal Holiday. Then here's this
band of
goofy assholes nobody really knows and the song we want to represent us
is
Wolfman? I felt we just shot ourselves in the foot and there was no way
we'd be chosen for the record.<br>
</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yet to my complete and utter shock
and horror we actually were picked. A few years later</span><b>
we discovered Donnie hated us and hated the song but he had no choice.
The ONLY reason we got picked for the fourth slot
was because we were the only other band that submitted a studio quality
recording, every other band had submitted poor quality home recordings
made on boom boxes or 4-tracks or whatever. So that free trip to the
studio really
paid
off. To be on the compilation we had to fork over 40 bucks or so and in
return
we'd get a box of records to sell at our shows. We, of course, never
bothered
to go pick up our records. We only ended up with a handful of copies.
Lethargic, indeed. But I don't think it would've matter since we never
would've sold one anyway. I mean, let's
think this through. All 4 bands on
this thing were playing at the same club to the same scene of people.
But those
bands had legit followings. Anybody who wanted to buy this compilation
would've already bought the album from those bands. Plus Lucy's was a
record shop where that record was being sold on a daily basis. By time
we got around to playing another show, everybody in this little punk
scene would've already had the stupid thing. Who would buy our copies?
And knowing how bad our next show would be, there's no way anybody
would buy anything from us. I
guarantee we would still be sitting here with 50 records had we
bothered to pick them up. <br>
</b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe even more embarrassing than
putting Wolfman on that
compilation is that being on the compilation also meant we were to be
interviewed in the HoP fanzine. We, of course, acted like total idiots
and
said some of the
dumbest things ever. It's
something that I love to pull out every once in a while just to relive
the hilarity of how embarrassingly dumb we were. And like I said, the
guy hated us. He still hated us years later as adults. And he had to
put up with this nonsense. The article started right off with an
insult. Oh look, here's the interview here:</b></p>

<center>
<center><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Lethargic is a young Nashville
band that has the potential to be really cool, if they stick with it
and get a clue. This interview took place on May 9, 1993 at Lucy's
Record Shop. The band is Cretin - bass and vocals, Michael - guitar and
Jason - drums. Most of Jason and Mike's answers were unintelligible on
the tape so they're not included, sorry.</b></font>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>HOP: When did Lethargic form and why? </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Cretin: We started about two years ago
because everybody else's music is boring. The big bands think they have
to be big and play a certain way and then all the bands around here
think they have to be different, so THEY all play a certain way. We
figure if every one of our songs is completely different then they'll
all be different in a different way. (huh?-ed.) </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>HOP: So how would you describe your
music then?
</b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Cretin: Loud. I guess it has a punk
rock type groove. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>HOP: A lot of people would say that
you've been worshipping at the altar of Danzig based on your vocal
style and appearance. </b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Mike: We would say that too!! </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Cretin: Well, I don't think any of our
music sounds like Danzig, although we do have one song that sounds like
the Misfits.
</b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>HOP: What about the song on the 7"
comp.? The vocals on that one sound a lot like Danzig. Is Danzig an
influence? </b></font>
</p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Cretin: Okay!!! Danzig IS a influence
now that you mention it. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>HOP: So you guys have been around for
two years yet I can count the times you've played out on one hand, why
is that? </b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Cretin: I've seen a lot of bands in
this town that seem to practice once or twice and then play out and
really suck. We don't want to be like that so we practiced for about a
year before we played our first show. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Jason: Although you really can't tell.
</b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Cretin: Yeah, you couldn't tell we've
practiced that much but we have. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>HOP: You've just talked a lot about
Nashville's music scene. Do you think Nashville's scene sucks? </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Cretin: I don't know. No, not really,
not if we're in it and Teen Idols are in it. However, it seems like a
lot of people around here think they have to be different and that
makes them all the same.
</b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>HOP: How old are you guys? Aren't you
all still in high school? </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Cretin: Yeah, all three of us graduate
in June. I'm going to college, hopefully to take engineering and I'm
sure music will still be a big part of my life.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>HOP: What do you want for Lethargic?
Do you want to do this seriously or is this all just for fun? </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Cretin: We've never thought about that
before.
</b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Jason: We wanna play Starwood! </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Mike: If we can make money doing this,
we'll be a full-time band. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Jason: We just need to sell-out. </b></font>
</p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Cretin: We're trying to write sell-out
songs but it's not working. A lot of bands are always saying how
they'll never sell out but we think that's stupid. If you like what you
play then you can't sell out. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Jason: What exactly is selling out? </b></font>
</p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Cretin: How can you sell out if you
WANT to make it big? And if you do, then how is that selling out?
You're still doing what you want to do. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>HOP: Cretin, you also play in No
Remorse. How do you set your priorities? </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Cretin: Well, we usually practice
during the week and No Remorse practices on the weekends, so it works
out ok. </b></font>
</p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>HOP: If you had to pick between the
two bands which would you stay with? </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Cretin: I'd probably go with Lethargic
since I've always wanted to sing and stuff. In No Remorse I'm the
rhythm guitarist and background singer. People always look at the
singer, lead guitarist, the bass player and the drummer. Nobody pays
any attention to the rhythm guitarist! </b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>HOP: Do you have any plans or
aspirations to play out of town? </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Cretin: No, we don't know anybody out
of town or have any contacts. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Jason: It all boils down to
this.....we're too stupid. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Cretin: Not to mention lazy. Like this
guy who's doing a magazine in Murfreesboro called and asked us for some
stuff to review and we never sent it. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>HOP: Why not?? </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Mike: We lost the address. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Cretin: We're just lazy I guess. We
can't even get local shows set up.<br>
</b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>HOP: So why cant you get off your
asses and work a little harder for your band? </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Jason: Well I'm still underage so we
couldn't play any other clubs yet anyway. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Cretin: Plus we're all still in
school, which sucks. When we get out we'll start doing a lot more. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>HOP: Anything else you'd like to tell
the world? </b></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Jason: Save the world, kill all the
people. </b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Cretin: We've got a business card but
no one can have one because we don't have enough, and we've got a demo
tape coming out soon.</b></font></p>
<span style="font-family: MS Sans Serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></span>
</center>
</center>

<p><b>Jesus.&nbsp; H.&nbsp; Christ.&nbsp; After reading that I have no
idea why I haven't hung myself yet. <br>
</b></p>

<p><b>Hold on, hold on, this isn't going to make anything better but
let me explain a couple of things in there.</b></p>

<p><b>Firstly, Keaton is called Cretin in the interview because at this
point we all had some stupid band names. At some point around here we
had a Hallmark store open up and I was in there with my mom one day and
saw that they had a business card making machine. I decided Lethargic
needed a business card. I don't remember what all it said but I'm
pretty sure it had the band name and underneath that it said "the
heaviest band in the world". Oof. Also I put our
band names as Cretin Grims,
Jason Ramone and Michael J. McFly. I only printed 1 card despite their
being 3 members. We were all very excited for our one business card.
For some reason we
used those band names for this interview and that's why Keaton is
called
Cretin in the interview. But since the magazine didn't print last
names you have no idea that we were all using fake names and it makes
it seem like there was Jason, there was Mike and then some weird dude
named Cretin. I mean, he acted like
a Cretin in the interview so I guess it fit.<br>
</b></p>

<p><b>Secondly, I totally forgot until 5 minutes ago
that Keaton claimed he was going to college for engineering. I once
watched this guy take over a minute to figure out how to
open our refridgerator door because the handle was on the side of the
door instead of
the front.&nbsp; Now he's going to be an engineer? The closest thing he
ever came to engineering was the time he tried to cook a fish with his
car. He read in some magazine or something that it was possible to cook
a piece of fish on an engine block. He was so excited about this and
went on and on about it. Sometime after reading this he took his
girlfriend on a trip to Gatlinburg. On the way there she started
wondering why the car was stinking like fishy death. They got stunk out
of the car and Keaton had to reveal that he had put fish on the engine.
What she thought was a romantic getaway turned out to be nothing but an
excuse for him to try to cook a fish with his car. I'm pretty sure they
didn't eat it. But I really don't
remember Keaton EVER having any real plans for college and he damn sure
didn't
follow them if he had any. He went to community college for a
year or so before quitting. That's not how you become an engineer.<br>
</b></p>

<p><b>And like was mentioned in the interview, at this point Keaton had
started playing
guitar for another band called No Remorse. It wasn't nearly as big deal
as the Friction thing was. No Remorse was good so I didn't blame him, I
would've wanted to play with them too. The bands were cool with each
other, they loaned us their bass equipment for every show we did. Their
singer
was Keaton's best friend, it would make sense he'd like to play with
them. And I never felt like they were a threat to steal him away
because Lethargic was more Keaton's thing than what they were doing and
with us he was the lead singer and main writer, he wasn't going to
give that up. <br>
</b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing we did around this time
was make Lethargic: The Movie. Rock bands back then used to put out all
these VHS home movies featuring backstage stuff and live footage and
music videos and yadda yadda. I felt we should make one. I spent a
whole lot of time working on this. I wrote out a whole script for it.
We
did a few comedic skits and we all did fake, scripted interviews. I
then took all this stuff and edited it together with clips from our
shows and stuff filmed at home. It actually turned out good and funny.
I was very proud of it. But I didn't have a way to dub from VHS to VHS
yet so I only had one copy. After watching it one day I accidentally
left it in the VCR and my befuddling grandmother recorded Days of our
Lives over it.
This was already something that drove me crazy with her. She never
checked a tape before she hit record. It seemed so crazy to me. Why
wouldn't you want to make sure you weren't recording over something you
didn't want to lose? Why wouldn't you want to make sure the tape
had enough space left to record whatever it was you wanted to record?
She was constantly confused because it'd run out of tape, that would
cause the VCR to rewind it all the way to the start of the tape and
then she'd never find what
she recorded. This frustrated me for decades because she continued to
use VCRs years past everyone else. But the day I noticed her using it
and
remembered my tape had been in there was utterly heartbreaking. I was
furious and on the brink of tears over it and she didn't give a rat's
ass. She just fussed at me for not getting the tape out. And I'm like
that's really your only response? Of course I should've remembered to
get it out but you can't say "oh, my bad, I didn't mean to, sorry for
erasing one of the most cherished mementos of your childhood with
a meaningless episode of Days of Our Lives"? It still breaks my heart
today that I can't go back
and watch this thing. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b><u>Chapter 6<br>
</u></b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We played our next and final show
at Lucy's Record
Shop in March of 93. We were now coming in hot off the heels of our big
appearance in the zine and our first song being released on the
compilation. We came into the show with higher expectations behind us
and an irrational level of confidence. But even in it's best moments
this show turned out to be a massive trainwreck. The rest of the time
it was just a mere catastrophe. The crowd had definitely grown since
the last show plus we were put on a much better bill with everybody's
favorite band Dumpster Juice. A bunch of people
from school came out including people from No Remorse and Teen Idols
and some even knew and liked our songs at this point. It seemed like
this should've been our moment to take the bull by the horns and take a
step forward. We almost started feeling cool and that was a terrible
mistake because we promptly when on that stage and stunk the joint out.
But the way we acted
it was like we couldn't smell it. This show smelled worse than my
farty mandolin class. This wasn't the "just happy to be
here" Lethargic of the high school concert, this was the stupid
unintelligble assholes from the fanzine interview.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>The first mistake we made was...well, the first
mistake
we made was leaving the house. Mike was screwing up absolutely
everything. He forgot songs, he forgot solos, he was a
mess. We
played a cover of The Misfits' song Bullet which was slower than it
should've been. Keaton decides to scream
FASTER into the mic like that helped. I knew it was slow but I
figured let's just get through it, maybe nobody will notice. Once
Keaton screamed FASTER there wasn't a person for 2 blocks that didn't
know that we had a slug playing drums. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Immediately after that it was time for A GREAT
MOMENT IN LETHARGICNESS! <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Uncle Daddy played before us. They were a much more
popular, better, more respected, liked and connected band in the
Nashville punk scene. They put on a real show. We had no business
playing after them. Not only were they good and all that, but they were
very theatrical and really tried to put on a show. As part of their
finale they had thrown popcorn all
over the
place and as we were setting up I noticed a bunch of it on the stage.
In the backstage area before we played, I spied a
broom leaning in the doorway to the stage area. I suggested "hey,
Keaton, lets pretend we messed up a song and
you say you can't perform with all this popcorn everywhere, get this
broom and sweep it up and then go back to playing." Keaton LOVED
the idea. So after we messed up Bullet, without trying, Keaton stops
the shows and
says "I know why we keep screwing up". He disappears backstage
for
what felt like an hour sitting on that stage. Turns out that between
then and now the broom had been moved and now he was back there
furiously running around trying to find it. Mike and I were stuck
on that stage listening to people in the crowd
asking where he went. I don't even think Mike knew about the idea,
he was just looking around perplexed and I was busy trying to bite into
my
strychnine
capsule. Eventually the crowd got bored waiting and just started having
conversations amongst themselves. After finally finding it, Keaton
comes back on stage, leans
into the microphone and says "damn popcorn" and starts sweeping all the
popcorn off the stage and onto the floor. There were maybe 2 or 3
people that laughed. I
was one of them. Most people groaned. There was one particularly loud
groan from the back of the room. This was from Donnie. Donnie was the
guy who hated our guts. Donnie was the one who was forced to put our
awful song
on his compilation. Donnie was the one who had to conduct that stupid
interview. Donnie was the one who let us play on his shows despite his
better judgement. Donnie was also the guy who, while we were backstage
goofing off, had spent time cleaning the popcorn up off the
floor. He didn't want the popcorn getting stomped into the club's
carpeted floor. We had no idea about that at the time. So after putting
in the effort to clean it all up, Donnie had to sit back there and
watch this asshole he already hated throw the popcorn he
just cleaned up back on the floor. And on top of all that, it felt like
we were trying to insult Uncle Daddy. Keaton could've came
back out, pulled his pants down and dropped a log on the stage like GG
Allin and gotten a
better reaction. Keaton and I thought this whole sweeping popcorn bit
was going to be a laugh riot and all we got were moans. To make
things worse, Keaton puts his bass back on, acts like he's fixing to
start
playing but stops...holds up his finger to say wait a minute...starts
hocking up a loogie and spits it on the stage behind the bass amp. Even
more moans and groans. This was not part of the popcorn idea. I don't
know where this came from. We had zero ability to read a room. We were
not very good at improv.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>After that debacled we moved on to the next and
debuted my song, Monkey Boy. Keaton
announced that this song was written by the drummer. It got me
some
applause and made me feel all special inside. He also said "so if you
don't like it you can blame him" but whatever. This was a big moment
for the dumber to get his first song out there. I count the song
off and we begin...and there's only bass and drums. Mike has forgot the
song.&nbsp; We stop and Keaton says "ok, I'm ready now" even though
it's
obvious he was the one who was actually playing.&nbsp; I count the song
off
again and we begin for real this time. But this time the bass is
playing in E and the guitar
is playing in A. Meanwhile I'm biting that strychnine capsule as hard
as I can and the damn thing just refuses to break open. So they play
the
first few seconds of the song or so in a different key and then Keaton,
who didn't bother to learn the words, just yells a bunch of random
nonsense and then says monkey boy a lot. The song was totally
murdered which was pretty awesome after he made sure to give me credit
for it. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Despite the poor performance of Monkey Boy the guys
at school the next day really liked it and were talking to me about it.
One in particular, I think his named was Bob, really liked it and
asked me what it was about. In reality I wrote the song about this one
particular guy in one of my classes who annoyed me. He was some sort of
foreign kid. I don't know where he was from but it wasn't here. But
every single time he came to class he would enter it and he would dance
around like a monkey for a while until the teacher would kick him out
and one time she called him "monkey boy". He didn't show up everyday
but when he did, he would bounce around the room doing his weird monkey
dance and then get kicked out and disappear. Every time. He annoyed the
piss out of everybody with his stupid monkey dance. So I wrote these
lyrics about him:</b></p>

<p align="left"><b><span style="font-style: italic;">Why do you act
like an animal</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">It doesn't take
Sherlock Holmes to see how incredibly racist this comes off as. Calling
somebody a
monkey boy and telling them to back to their own country? Lawd have
mercy. But the guy was LITERALLY from another country. He LITERALLY
danced like a monkey. The teacher was the one who dubbed him monkey
boy. I wasn't trying to write the KKK anthem here but, being assholes,
we
also found it hilarious how racist the lyrics sounded so it was
hilarious...to us. So when Bob asked me what it was about I thought I
was
going to make a big funny and I told him...ahem..."black people". I
thought we'd all laugh together and then I'd explain the real story.
Nope. It was an
immediate reaction. Bobby went completely stoned face. He got up and
left. He never spoke to me again. Lethargic winning over hearts and
minds one person at a time. As I said, we had no ability to read a room.</span><br>
</p>

<p align="left"><b>After Monkey Boy it was time for another GREAT
MOMENT IN LETHARGICNESS!&nbsp;
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Keaton had gotten his hands
on a little black
candle. I don't know where he got it from but I'm betting THE THING
gave it to him. So having this black candle, he decided that he
was going to bring it to the club and hold a seance in the middle of
the show. He never bothered to plan out what this seance was actualy
going to be
though. The only planned part was
that I would play some little voodoo beat on the toms while he lit the
candle and then did whatever the hell he was going to decide to
do. The whole popcorn and spitting on stage improv turned out so well
so naturally we should do more of that. We tried to talk him out of
this idea for weeks. Much like Wolfman, he
wouldn't listen. I had hoped he would chicken out when it was
actually time for it and after the colossal failure of the popcorn
incident I fully expected him to...but he
didn't. He went for it. He orders me to start my beat. I
do. He pulls out
the candle and starts making magical motions around it with his hands
like he's David Copperfield and he's gonna make it disappear. After a
few seconds of this he stops and goes to the mic and asks "does anyone
have a lighter". Lord have mercy. He had planned this for
weeks. He brought his stupid candle but he didn't bring a way to light
it. What? The? Piss? After a century of waiting,
somebody hands him a lighter. He starts up his silly hand
movements again and goes to light the candle but
then suddenly stops dead in his tracks. All the humor leaves his body
as he holds the candle
up and looks to the back of the room and asks the following question
with all the seriousness that you would expect somebody to ask "Is my
child going to live, doctor?" He looks up and asks "Is it OK if I
light this in here?" It's a two inch tall candle. What did
he expect to happen? NO!!! DON'T LIGHT THAT IN HERE! IT'LL SUCK ALL THE
OXYGEN OUT OF THE ROOM AND WE'LL ALL DIE!!!!</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>He finally lights the stupid thing, does some more
mumbo jumbo over it with his hand and then goes to set it down.&nbsp;
He tries to set it on top of the bass stack but then decides maybe he
should not put a melting candle on top of somebody else's
equipment. So he turns and looks around for some place
else to put it. He starts to set it on the stage, but the stage
is all
wood, so he thinks that's a bad idea. Plus there's already popcorn
there after
all. He looks all around trying to find a place he
can set it while my first full beard grows in.&nbsp; Eventually he just
looks out to the crowd, makes a "oh well" face and then blows the
candle back out. That was it. That was the seance.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Kids, if you're going to do something dumb, at least
plan it out first. If you're gonna light a candle, maybe bring a
lighter and maybe bring a candle holder.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Then we go immediately from the seance into what is
probably our
worse song ever called Bridge That River. And picking one song out as
our worst is really saying something. This was a brand new song Keaton
had written only a couple of weeks
prior. For some reason we felt this song was SOOOOOOOOOOOO good
that we had to perform it immediately. This song is
embarrassingly awful. No words justify it. First of all, it was a
looooong, sloooooow drone of a song and by this
time we had pretty much 100% become a punk band. This entire set
list was all of our fastest songs but for some reason we HAD to throw
this
complete garbage right into the middle of the set&nbsp;to slow
everything down
to a crawl. This coming up right after the seance was a brilliant
move because there were, I think, 4 people left who had not gotten
bored and walked out, so this song took care of those last 4. The
chorus is what takes the cake though. Every time I hear this song I do
a spit take when I hear the
chorus. Keaton had tried to base the chorus around that old
saying "we'll cross that bridge when we come to it" or whatever it
is. Keaton's interpretation was a BIT different. The chorus
is him going into his full on Danzig impersonation and yelling over and
over again....</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>I'LL....BRIDGE THAT RIVER.....WHEN I COME.....WHEN I
COME!!!</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Quite possibly the worst lyric ever written.
The song
was SO boring and SO stupid and the crowd hated it SO&nbsp;much we
could literally look out into the crowd and see that people were
wishing a comet would land on us. Keaton's answer to spice up
the song was to start
yelling it louder and louder and louder as the song droned on and on
and on.&nbsp; </b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="5">I'LL BRIDGE THAT RIVER.....WHEN I
COME.....WHEN I COME!!!</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Very few things in this life has ever made me laugh
more
than the video of us playing this damn song. It finally ends and we go
back to doing a couple of punk covers which brings a few people back
in. After that....we hit the brakes once more for....</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>A GREAT MOMENT IN LETHARGICNESS!</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Keaton had written a song and recorded it on his
boom
box called Can I Come to Dinner<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>.
It was pretty funny. I mean, at least funny when you're 15 or 16 kind
of a funny. I thought we should speed it up, slap some
distortion on the thing and turn it into a Lethargic
song. He wouldn't do it. On the day of the show, his No
Remorse buddies kept egging him on to play the song. He refused
the
request. But now, in the middle of everything, after the stunning
failures of not only the show
as a whole but of the double whammy of the popcorn incident and the
candle seance, he felt like the show needed a boost. He suddenly
stopped the show and decided on a
complete and utter whim, with no advance warning to the other two
members of
the band, that he was going to play Can I Come to Dinner. <br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>He turns to Mike and says "give me the guitar". I'm
sitting there like "WTF" and Mike is all "thank God, somebody take this
thing" and happily hangs it over. Keaton announces "you already know
how I suck at singing and playing bass, I'm about to show you how I
suck playing guitar". And boy he wasn't joking.<br>
</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>He took Mike's guitar from him so now he's standing
there for a second
holding both the
guitar by it's neck in one hand, and the bass by it's neck in the
other hand and he got a little jolt of electricity through him. He
didn't
quite
understand what happened though, he wasn't an engineer or anything,
because after the song when they switched
back he did the same thing again. He held the bass in one hand and the
guitar in
the other. This time he got shocked WAY worse. He was basically
slightly electrocuted on stage. He went a little rigid and a high
pitched voice
whimpered out "it's shocking me". People think he's joking and are
laughing at him but you can hear him going "sssssssssss" at the pain.
Man, I wish he would've
died. That would've been the only good thing that happened during
this show.&nbsp; Anyway, he gets the guitar and starts playing his big
song. But
it's not that funny this time around because he doesn't remember the
words and
makes up new inferior ones on the spot. He messes up a bunch of the
chords because he hadn't practiced it. It was really, really bad. Mike
tried to
play along on the bass despite never playing the song before. I
clanged around on the cymbals to not be bored. It was awful. By now the
entire room
was filled with lead balloons.&nbsp; </b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then we go back into
another one of our more punk songs called Jannelly. This was supposed
to be our Judy is a Punk type of a song,
written about Jannell, the bass player from the Teen Idols who sang on
Little Off Dead. And it went really, really well. The crowd really dug
the
song...until the end section. At the end of the song it suddenly
slows all the way down and Keaton did this awful chant of PUNK PUNK
PUNK
PUNK PUNK. The song did that for a good minute it felt like. It's
like we somehow thought doing this would lead to the crowd chanting
PUNK PUNK PUNK PUNK along with us and it would be some kind of cool
moment. Instead it just turned into Keaton screaming PUNK PUNK
PUNK PUNK PUNK by himself and looking like a douche while the crowd
stared with blank
faces once again.&nbsp; </b></p>

<p align="left"><b>We finally finish the show off with that stupid
Wolfman
song again and I immediately jumped up in a fury ready to pack up my
crap and cry in the car. But we needed one more awkward moment. Mike
had spent much of the show seeming confused and now he stood there
confused again. As if he didn't remember that Wolfman was our last
song. I had already got up, Keaton was taking his bass off, Mike just
stood there the exact same way he stood there the whole show, looking
at Keaton and me trying to figure out what the next song was. Because
of this it made the crowd think we were still going. They're not
leaving, they're still staring at us, waiting for our next song. This
confuses Keaton now. So he
stops taking his bass off and now he's looking around like he's not
sure what's going on. It
almost makes it seem like we're doing a fake encore thing or we're not
actually done. A couple of people
start asking for one more, but I'm already unscrewing drums, I ain't
doing one more nothing. Keaton has to tell them we're done and
Mike is still just standing there like a weirdo and I'm dead inside.<br>

<b><b><u>Chapter 7</u></b><br>
</b>
<p><b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I hadn't been worried about the
whole Keaton in No Remorse thing, it started to seem I was completely
wrong. Throughout the course of our senior year and on into the
following summer when Lethargic would finally give up the ghost, Keaton
slowly and surely seemed to be cutting us out of his life. He still
showed up
for band practice sometimes, usually late, but the days
of hanging out were few and far between. It was practice and practice
only. He pretty much stopped
having anything to do with us at school and was almost constantly
hanging with the No Remorse guys or Jannell from Teen Idols. The three
of used to sit together in the back row of Music Theory class every day
and work on Lethargic stuff or assignments. But by the end of our
senoir year it was only Mike
and I back there while Keaton set upfront with those guys. I don't even
think Jannell wasn't actually in the class. She was just Queen Bee of
the whole string band stuff so she just hung out there all the time and
almost always seemed to be around. Keaton would
only come back to see us if he had something to say about the band like
he had a
new song or something and then he'd leave and go back to sit with them.
We
didn't really see
him anymore. <br>
</b></b></p>

<p><b><b>Towards the end of our last year of school, big news came down
the pipe. It was time for the next Original Music Fest
and this time around we were gonna be the headlining band, not the
openers. This was a terrible idea of course. We had no business being
the main band on any show. Outside of our little circle of friends in
these music classes, nobody cared or knew who we were. Nobody else was
going to come back to school at night because Lethargic was playing.
Looking back, almost every "success" we had was purely based on lucky
timing. All the bands we played with the previous year had graduated
and left. We were the only ones left so there was no other choice for
the headliner. The school loaned the 4-track to us because nobody else
wanted it. They took us to the recording studio because nobody else
wanted to go. We got on the compilation because nobody else had a good
recording. If we had been a year older, Friction and Nobody's Chyld
would have taken all these opportunities from us.<br>
</b></b></p>

<p><b><b>But we were really excited at the time anyway. This was the scene of
our
one and
only victory. </b><b>Once
again our confidence went up when it shouldn't have and this time none
of our excitement was actually about getting to play our music for
people. We didn't decide to hunker down and practice and try to put on
a good show. Nope. We were excited because this was another
opportunity to be assholes. We
hatched a plan to go out in style. We were gonna hit that stage
and play until we couldn't play any more. We were the seniors now
buddy, we were gonna Nobody's Chyld this thing! We made a set
list that was literally every
single song we had, including tons of cover songs. We were gonna
go up there and annoy the crap out of everybody and play and play and
play until they
kicked us off stage. Keaton and I thought it was a hilarious idea. Mike
didn't like the idea but he didn't care enough to fight about these
things like Keaton and I did. But a big monkey wrench got thrown into
our plan anyway. Keaton's new love life.<br>
</b></b></p>

<p><b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had some good news and we had some
bad news. Keaton had
finally broken up with THE THING. That was awesome. He was back to
being himself and not the gloomy emo douche. The bad news is
that as usual, the reason he was finally over her was because he found
somebody cooler. He had left THE THING behind and moved on to...THE MESS. He was now almost always stuck up the ass of Jannell
from Teen Idols despite the fact that she already had a boyfriend who she was in Teen Idols with. I
once accidentally walked in on Keaton talking to somebody about having
anal sex with Jannell and I threw up in my mouth a little bit. But I
guess from behind you wouldn't have to look at her face. But I can't imagine the other side looking any better. At
this point band practice was largely being ditched in favor of
hanging out with her. The real kicker about this is that by now my
parents
had divorced and my mom and I were living with my grandparents. There
was nowhere to put my drums there so they were now residing in Keaton's
basement and that's where the band practiced. With Keaton not being
around, not only was the band not practicing, Mike and I couldn't
practice without him and I couldn't practice at all.<br>
</b></b></p>

<p><b><b>So it was getting to the
point of should we even play this show at all much less try to do this
neverending setlist idea.&nbsp; We had weeks to prepare but only got to
practice a handful of times. Being the top band we ultimately felt like we had to
go through with it, but the "keep playing forever" plan
was still in debate up to right before we walked out on stage. Keaton
really, really, really wanted to do it, he begged us to do it. I was against it
because we hadn't practiced enough and many songs were brand new ones
we hadn't played much. Mike never wanted to do it but would do
whatever. I ultimately
decided to go for it. This was
the site of our greatest triumph and the only time I had truly had fun
playing a show from start to finish and left the stage happy instead of
embarrassed or mad. I was determined to have fun again and I didn't
care
if it was because we played well or because we just did something
stupid and annoyed people.&nbsp; </b></b></p>

<p><b><b>We hit the stage with our gigantic set list and it started off
fine, we were playing surprisingly well. This actually was
turning out to be another
good show. We even got to do something awesome and perform Little Off
Dead live
for the one and only time as Jannell was there to sing her part
and Mr. Pearcy was there to play the dobro part. But then it all came
crashing down. Keaton completely chickened out. After only
a few songs, he came back to me and whispered, "let's just do the
next song and leave" and I was immediately enraged yet again. We put up
with this cocksucker missing nearly every single practice
without one damn apology. We put up with him begging us to
still go ahead with the show AND the plan to play every single
song. We were having a good show. It was fun. Then out of
the blue he chickens out? I was livid! We got into an
argument on stage much worse than the Twist and Shout
argument at the KY party. I just couldn't believe it. We
were yelling at each
other. Mike didn't give a crap about anything as usual. I gave up,
played whatever the last song was, Wolfman I'm sure, and left because at that moment I
wanted no part of being around this asshole anymore. There wasn't
even a point to me trying to win this fight. The whole reason I
went along with the idea is because I wanted to have fun, it wasn't
going to be fun now either way so screw it. I left stage
and just left everybody behind and went to sit down in the auditorium
off by myself and fumed. I was sick of both of them. One was a
constant pain and one was a constant worm. It felt like it was over.</b></b></p>

<p><b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We somehow managed to keep the band
on
life support a few more
months.&nbsp; Later that summer we had another showed booked
at Lucy's. There was a slight problem though, our singer was now
totally MIA.&nbsp; Not like before.&nbsp; He wasn't showing up late, he
wasn't missing practice, he just plain didn't exist in our lives
anymore.&nbsp; We weren't in school anymore. We didn't have that one place where we knew we could always find him. He
could've been dead for all we knew. He never showed up and we
could
never get him on the phone. For two whole months we had no idea
where he was. 2 months of calling his house and leaving messages with
his parents and his brother and never getting a response. 2 months of
no pratice. 2 months of not even seeing my own drums. <br>
</b></b></p>

<p><b><b>Mike and I were ready to cancel the show when we decided to
make one
last ditch effort to save it. The day before the show we drove to Keaton's house to try to find him or see if his parents or
brother could find him for us. Hoping that if we could find him
we could at least get a practice in that night and see how we felt
after that. His dad was there but had no idea where Keaton was or when he'd
come back. So we headed back to the car to go home
and call off the show. Lo and behold, as we're about to pull out, another car pulls into the
driveway. It's Keaton and Janell. He saw us and came running over
to us all smiles,
happy and giddy. It was like how a dumb dog acts when it's owner comes
home from work. He laughed and asked "what are YOU guys doing here???" and I replied "looking for you". Then he just running off at the mouth like
everything was completely normal without asking why we were looking for him. He started blabbing about how he had
a set list ready
for the show and he had some new songs to show us and all this crazy crap.
He wouldn't shut up. It was like he was on speed.
We both stared at him in total disbelief until I finally
snapped and yelled "A SET LIST?!?!?!".&nbsp; <br>
</b></b></p>
<p><b><b>The thing that always amazed
me the
most about Keaton was how oblivious he was. He would be the
biggest asshole in the world but he never realized it. He didn't
understand it. It seemed like to him that he had just seen us 2
days
before, not 2 months.&nbsp; Nothing at all was wrong in his
world. Everything was fine. It never even occured to him to think
it was weird that he just randomly ran into us at his parents house. It
was like it was a total normal thing for the two of us
to be parked in his parent's drive way for no apparent reason. And even
after I yelled at him, it was only a speed bump. He went right back to
blabbering on about his plans for the show and then said he had to go.
Jannell's asshole was going unserviced and he needed to get back to
that. We
asked him if he wanted to practice and he said he couldn't, he had to
go, he'd see us tomorrow at the show. He went in the house as Mike and
I stared at each other in disbelief. As soon as he walked away,
there was no
way in hell I was playing that show.&nbsp; </b>
</b></p>

<p><b><b>I went home and tried to call Lucy's that night but nobody
answered so I
ended up having to do the total jerk move of calling off the show on
the day of. After I did
that, it didn't take long for my phone to ring. Keaton was
totally blindsided and didn't understand. I tried to explain that
we
hadn't practiced in months and we weren't ready. Our last Lucy's show
was a disaster and that was WITH practice, to play a show WITHOUT
practice
would be really dumb. He didn't even really bother trying to change
my mind, he asked me to play, I said no, we said bye. A little while
later the phone rings again and this time it's Jannell. This idiot done
sent his sloppy seconds after me. LOL. What a terrible plan. I mean,
Keaton had at least a 1% chance of talking me into it. But
the moment I heard her voice come through that phone, sticking her nose
where it didn't belong, there was 0% chance I would change my mind. I
was mad before, now smoke
poured out of my ears. First of all, because she was butting in
our business, secondly because Keaton obviously gave her my number and
put her up to it in yet another Friction-like situation, and thirdly
because she called Mike first and put the guilt trip on
him and he fell right for it. Calling him first let her pull out the
old, well, Mike
said that HE would play if YOU would play card. So now I'm pissed at
him too for
being a spineless pushover again. I get off the phone with her and call
Mike. Now he's being all wishy washy and talking about playing. It
was so annoying. Jannell calls me again. I kept telling her that I
wasn't
going to play a show that we had zero practice for. I wasn't interested
in embarrasing myself. She kept trying to change my mind. Eventually I
told her flat out how I felt. I told her how Keaton being stuck up her
ass, literally, was basically the reason all
this happened in the first place and him having her call me made me
want to play the show even less. I was not doing it. I hung up. But
yet *I* still felt bad. It sucked to do that to the people putting it
on. I felt bad about cancelling the show, I felt bad that my band
seemed dead and I felt
bad about having to argue with this girl who had never actually done
anything
wrong directly to me. I guarantee that Keaton didn't feel bad about any
of it.<br>
</b></b></p>

<p><b><b>Jannell's attempt
to help not only didn't help at all, it lead to more than
just the show being cancelled, it led to Mike and I quitting the
band. This was a lot more serious than all the other times we
had kicked Keaton out. WE quit. Keaton could keep the band for himself
and
shove it up his ass. Or Jannell's. Particularly that Wolfman song. That's the way we
felt. Well, I did anyway. Mike just went along with it because I don't
think he really cared either way. We were done,
it was finished. <br>
</b></b></p>

<p><b><u><b>Chapter 8<br>
</b></u></b></p>

<p><b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, no, it wasn't.&nbsp; The
band
had one last small gasp left in
it. Much like the drum stick beating I gave Keaton, this appeared
to be another wake up call. After a while he came crawling back
to his old friends yet again and we decided to try the band one more
time but with some major changes. Since I couldn't play drums
at my house anymore, I had fully taken up playing bass and by now I was
a lot
better at it than Keaton was so we decided that I would become the new
bass player, Keaton would focus on singing and we'd find a new
drummer. We also trashed all our songs and started writing new
ones. Only now that I was on bass, Mike had been almost totally pushed
out of writing. And with just me and Keaton doing the writing,
the songs got way faster and way shorter and, we felt, way
better. There was no messing around anymore, we were now
completely a punk band and everything seemed like it was going in a
good direction. This was the most serious effort we had ever put into
actually trying to not suck and I was as excited about the band as I had ever been.<br>
</b></b></p>

<p><b><b>The problem? No drummer. Jannell's brother Steve,
the
drummer of Teen Idols, wanted to join because he really liked our stuff. He
had literally been a fan since day one. He was the first guy I saw when
I walked off stage after our very first show and he loved it. He was at
every show we did except the party and he would be singing along with the songs. We were ecstatic about the idea. We
didn't care that we'd be
sharing a drummer and we'd be second fiddle to them because the guy was
an awesome drummer. But we never got to play with him because he
ended up getting in some sort of trouble and he was forced to move to Oklahoma, leaving both bands behind. And all the
searching
in the world didn't find us another drummer. This is a theme that
will be revisited several times. We were stocking up song after
song. Songs we really liked. But it slowly just started to
seem like a total waste of time as no drummer ever showed up. <br>
</b></b></p>
<p><b><b>Eventually all the Jannell ass
kissing paid off and Keaton was asked to become the singer for Teen
Idols. They were the undisputed kings of the scene at the time
and it felt
impossible and stupid for me to try to talk him out of it just to
stay with our
little drummer-less band that could blow up at any time. Keaton left
and Lethargic was finally officially done. But for all the ways it
could've ended, it wound up ending in the most friendliest of terms
possible particularly between Keaton and myself. We didn't end over
another fight, we ended because there just wasn't a reason to keep on
and everybody knew it.<br>
</b></b></p>

<p><b><b>But this era with the band turned out to be the most fun I
had. Playing bass and being able to be a bigger part of the song
writing
was a blast and I wanted that to continue. And it did. I wrote and
wrote and wrote and wrote. I stockpiled dozens of songs with the idea
that one day things would change. I'd get a 4-track of my own, I'd get
my drums back and be
able to record all these songs properly. My songs were mostly straight
ahead Ramones type punk songs or half ass Nirvana grunge rip offs or just plain really weird since I was
writing on a bass.
I figured it'd be
easier to write songs on guitar than on bass so I eventually picked up a cheap
Univox hollow body guitar at Madison Music, the coolest guitar I ever had,
and put my
Ramones bar chords back to use. I got busy writing even more. I wrote
song after
song after song. I filled up cassette tape after cassette tape
with song ideas. They mostly sucked but it was a start.</b></b></p>

<p><b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike and I remained friends for a
while
and
would occasionally get together and play some music. Usually just us
two
but a couple times his old drummer buddy Richard would play
with us and it almost felt like a band again for a few minutes.
Essentially though it was just us taking a huge step back in time and
becoming two guys in a bedroom playing Motley Crue songs without a
strobe
light flashing. Sometimes I would get him to play along with me on some
of the songs I had written but there was no spark to it. There wasn't
even a slight hint that hey, we should try to start something new.<br>
</b></b></p>

<p><b><b>That friendship
ended up slowly fizzling out over time. He got a
job at a
warehouse and he started being heavily influenced by his new "cool"
co-workers who just sounded like the latest version of Kenny
Hendricks to me. He started drinking a lot&nbsp;and getting into all
their interests which meant the interests we had shared all these years
were being replaced by new stuff that didn't hold any appeal to me whatsoever. It was becoming
un-cool to hang out with the dork who didn't drink or party and just
wanted to play music. A long time went by where we only talked on
the phone every once in a while (I would call him, he would never call
me anymore) and when I finally did see him in person again it was only
because I just happened to bump into him at a movie theater with his
friend from work and a couple of girls. I assumed they were on a double
date. I was floored by what I saw. One
look at him and I knew we were done. He was wearing
completely different clothes, he had a thick gold chain around his neck
and his hair was chopped off. I couldn't believe he had changed so much
in the blink of an eye like that. He wasn't the same person anymore. I couldn't help it. I
didn't mean to. I laughed when I saw him and made some joking comment
like "nice haircut". The three of us always busted each other's balls.
It's what
we did. We played music and we made fun of each other. But this
time instead of reacting like a friend reacts when you bust his balls
he acted like a stranger came up and pissed in his Fruit Loops. He made
a face. Acted like he smelled something, made some pointless small talk
and left as fast as he could.<br>
</b></b></p>

<p><b><b>After that awkward meeting I decided
I wouldn't bother calling him anymore, if our friendship had any more
life to it, he would call me. I wasn't going to keep trying to CPR this
thing. He never called. I bumped into
him one last time at a video rental place. He was in the video game
section with Richard. As soon as I saw them both I walked
right up smiling and said HEY! I said it in the way somebody would say
HEY
to their best friend if he ran into them at a store, not in some
sarcastic asshole way or anything. I was actually happy to see
him again and hopeful he'd be happy to see me. He apparently wasn't
interested. At all. Richard acted cool like he didn't know anything was
wrong but Mike had a look of absolute disgust on his face as he mumbled
"where YOU been?" I
said "nowhere". He looked to Richard, said "let's go" and
they left. And that was it. I was shocked for a few seconds and then I started laughing. What
had I actually done to him that he was so mad that we couldn't occupy
the same building?
I hadn't forced him to talk to me on the phone? I couldn't
believe how quickly he went from being my best friend since 7th grade
to total douche so fast. So I just went ahead
and started looking for a game to rent and started laughing again when
I realized that my showing up had so upset him for some reason that he
left the store without getting to rent anything for himself. I hope
whatever game I rented that day was the one he was looking for and he
went back later to get it and it wasn't there. <br>
</b></b></p>

<p><b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With both Keaton and Mike gone, I
completely focused on learning guitar and writing more songs. I really wished
for a way that I could just record music on my own. I
thought about trying to find a new band but I really didn't know
how. After all, my entire musical existence had been with those 2 guys.
I didn't really know anybody else. It's not like being in Lethargic got
me any great contacts or anything. I wasn't in school anymore where I
could bump into a guy in science class who happened to play guitar and
sing again. The musician classifieds seemed like a terrifying idea
because I wasn't at all comfortable
enough with my guitar or bass playing that I could go audition to join
somebody else's band or
anything.&nbsp; </b>
</b></p>

<p><b><b>I was stuck writing songs with nothing to do with them. Not sure what I wanted to do at all. Perhaps I
should just go back to play with GI Joes? But one day,
out of the blue, somebody unexpected came knock, knock, knocking on my
door. <br>
